They want limited government intervention, prefer business growth and job creation over wealth redistribution and equity initiatives, and support more funding for traditional law enforcement over community programs.\n\nTreva Reid's stances on affordable housing programs, expanding social services, and investing more in community-based violence prevention likely do not align well with this voter's stated policy preferences and conservative political leanings. However, her support for increasing OPD staffing and police academies does match the voter's priority on public safety. Her commitment to bringing jobs and economic opportunity to the Coliseum site could also appeal to the voter's pro-business and pro-economy views.\n\nOverall, I would predict low to moderate issue alignment between this voter and candidate Treva Reid based on the background information provided. The voter would likely not consider her an ideological match but may find some overlap with her on discrete issues like public safety and economic development. Additional information could provide further insight into the extent of issue alignment between this voter and candidate.", "Gregory Hodge": " Based on the background information provided, here is a summary of candidate Gregory Hodge:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"name\": \"Gregory Hodge\", \n  \"background\": \"Gregory Hodge is a licensed attorney and social entrepreneur who operates Khepera Consulting.
