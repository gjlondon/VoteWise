Tell us about yourself.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tLoren Taylor is a third-generation Oaklander. He comes from a family with a history of public and community service, and has spent his life committed to serving Oakland. Loren holds a master’s in biomedical engineering from the University of Connecticut and an MBA from UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. \r\nHe spent his early professional career as a biomedical engineer and a management consultant for businesses and nonprofits. After serving as Director in PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Business Strategy & Innovation practice, Loren left corporate America to dedicate himself to empowering underserved people. He launched Custom Taylor Solutions, a social impact consulting firm based in Oakland that works with nonprofits and small businesses to improve the lives of disadvantaged communities. Through service and leadership positions with nonprofits and social justice organizations, Loren has worked for years to alleviate poverty and create economic opportunity in Oakland. \r\nCurrently, Loren proudly serves as the District 6 representative on Oakland’s City Council, where he takes a practical and data-driven approach to solving Oakland’s complex issues. As Councilmember, his decades of experience providing tailored solutions to cities and companies have enabled him to make measurable progress tackling the most difficult challenges. Loren lives in East Oakland with his wife, Dr. Erica Taylor, and their two children, Camryn and Manny.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPlease list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAs a third-generation son of Oakland, my dedication to waking up every single morning and working towards a better Oakland is deeply personal. My wife Erica and I have chosen to stay and raise our family here because of everything The Town represents: grit and hard work; diversity and equal opportunity for all; creativity and innovation. We need pragmatic, hands-on leadership to navigate the way forward—someone who focuses on the details of governing instead of the drama and grandstanding that too often holds us back. I’m running for Mayor to be that leader, one who unites our communities to realize Oakland’s potential. As Mayor, I’ll focus on delivering results rather than rhetoric and making progress rather than politics.\nOakland is in my DNA. I’m a proud third-generation Oaklander, born and raised in The Town. This is where I met my wife, started my small business, co-founded a community school and served as PTA president at my son’s public school. My love for Oakland is deep. My commitment to Oakland is personal.   In 2018, I was elected to the City Council, defeating a sixteen-year incumbent. Since then, I have brought my inclusive, pragmatic approach to some of our most difficult challenges. I’ll be a mayor who focuses on what matters to Oaklanders – one who cares about the details of governing instead of the drama and political grandstanding that too often holds us back. I know The Town can do better, and we will. Together.\nMany candidates will tell you they have a progressive vision of a better future for Oakland, but Oaklanders deserve a mayor who will roll up their sleeves and do the hard work necessary to make that vision a reality. Innovative, progressive, and pragmatic: that’s the mindset that will solve Oakland’s most pressing problems. That’s what I’ve proven I can do in my career and as a Councilmember, and that’s what I’ll do as Mayor. Together, we can make Oakland safer and a place where we all can live, learn, work, and play. Together, we can ensure that every Oaklander has access to housing they can afford, quality public education, and the opportunity to thrive. If you join me, together we will build a new future for ourselves and the city we lov\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhat areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t1. Making Oakland Neighborhoods Safer: Oaklanders deserve a place where they can all live, work and play.  I won’t tolerate more violence and crime; I will champion smart investments in violence prevention and partner with responsible law enforcement to keep Oakland safe. My public safety plan strikes the right balance between compassion and enforcement and between preventing crime and responding to it. I will deliver the “both-and” solution instead of an “either-or” excuse, and take an active role in everything from revisiting Oakland’s internal policies, recruitment, and hiring practices to exploring big systemic changes.\n\r\n2. Tackling Homelessness and Making Housing Affordable for All: Oakland’s next mayor needs to face our homelessness and housing crises head-on. I will close unsafe homeless encampments and move our unhoused neighbors into the shelters and treatment programs they need. As your next Mayor, just as I have done as a Councilmember, I will support building thousands of both affordable and market-rate units, so families can stay and thrive here in Oakland.\n\r\n3. Restoring Our Clean Streets: Our dirty streets are unacceptable. I will stop illegal dumping to make sure that Oaklanders can enjoy our public spaces and small businesses and commercial districts can thrive.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Ballotpedia reserves the right to edit Candidate Connection survey responses.

            "wiki_text": "Sheng Thao (born 1985) is an American politician and the 51st and current mayor of Oakland, California. She is the first Hmong American mayor of a major city in the United States.\n\nEarly life and education\nThao was born and raised in Stockton, California. Her parents were refugees from Laos who escaped Hmong genocide and eventually immigrated to the United States. Thao was the seventh of ten children and grew up in poverty, spending some of her childhood in public housing.At age 17, Thao moved out of her home and began working at a Walgreens in Richmond. After moving to Oakland in her 20s, she became a victim of domestic violence while in an abusive relationship. Thao left the relationship when she was six months pregnant, and then lived in her car and couch surfed before and after her son was born. When her son was ten months old, Thao began attending Merritt College in Oakland while raising her son as a single mother and working as a research assistant.After she completed an associate's degree in legal studies from Merritt, Thao transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, where she earned a bachelor's degree in legal studies and a minor in city planning. While at UC Berkeley, Thao helped create the Bear Pantry, a program which provided food to food-insecure students.\n\nEarly career\nFollowing her graduation from UC Berkeley in 2012, Thao worked for At-Large Councilmember Rebecca Kaplan as a paid intern. Thao later worked for Kaplan at the Oakland City Council and  became her chief of staff in 2017.\n\nOakland City Council\nThao served in the Oakland City Council's 4th district seat, representing the neighborhoods of Montclair, Laurel, Melrose, Redwood Heights, and the Dimond District. She was the first Hmong woman to be elected as a member of the city council in the state of California and the first Hmong person elected to the Oakland City Council. On the city council, Thao served as president pro tempore.Thao decided to run for office in 2018, when the election for the district 4 City Council seat was an open race, lacking an incumbent. Thao defeated six other candidates and won with 54% of the vote after seven rounds of instant-runoff voting tabulation. For each of the 7 rounds she had the most votes of any candidate. Thao's priorities which she ran on were tackling Oakland's housing crisis, improving public safety with better response systems and community policing, and building public infrastructure such as libraries and parks. One of Thao's opponents Charlie Michelson, had been endorsed by Mayor Libby Schaaf. During her campaign, Thao and fellow candidates Pamela Harris and Nayeli Maxson co-endorsed each other in the ranked-choice voting. Dubbing themselves the \"Women's Leadership Slate\", they urged voters to rank the three of them as their first three picks.After Kamala Harris was elected vice president of the United States, Thao and other elected officials lobbied Governor Gavin Newsom to appoint Barbara Lee to the U.S. Senate seat that Harris would vacate. Alex Padilla was ultimately appointed to the seat.\n\nMayoral campaign\nOn November 10, 2021, Thao announced her candidacy for the 2022 Oakland mayoral election.During her campaign, Thao was supported by many trade unions, and she was endorsed by the local Democratic Party and Rep. Ro Khanna. Loren Taylor, one of her opponents, was endorsed by Libby Schaaf, the incumbent mayor of Oakland, as well as London Breed and Sam Liccardo, the mayors of nearby San Francisco and San Jose. By the end of the campaign, Thao and Taylor were considered to be the two front-runners. Thao was viewed as a progressive candidate, while opponents Taylor and Ignacio De La Fuente were viewed as more centrist.In June 2022, a former staffer filed an informal verbal complaint with the Public Ethics Commission that alleged Thao had City Council staff work on her campaign in a possible violation of state election laws, and the staffer was fired after refusing to work on Thao's campaign. Thao denied the allegations and the ethics commission opened an investigation in June 2022. After the matter was reported by a political blogger that supported one of Thao's competitors in October 2022, the allegations gained media attention.Thao won the ranked-choice election by 677 votes in the final round of tabulation.\n\nMayoralty\nThao took office on January 9, 2023.Days into her mayoralty, Thao placed Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong on administrative leave over allegations that he had obstructed an investigation into a hit and run incident that involved a police officer. After a probe was conducted, Thao fired Armstrong on February 15, 2023.In April 2023, Thao announced that city would end long-standing negotiations with the owners of the Oakland Athletics for a waterfront ballpark making it likely that the MLB team will relocate to Las Vegas, Nevada after reaching an agreement to build a $1.5 billion new ballpark on the Las Vegas Strip. Thao later met with Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred during the 2023 MLB All-Star Game in which she outlined the city's plans for a new ballpark at the Coliseum or Howard Terminal from years prior through a document sent to him and 29 other MLB owners in a bid to keep the Athletics from relocating to Las Vegas three months after the Athletics' ballpark received public financing from the state of Nevada in a special session and the team beginning the relocation process to Las Vegas.\n\nPersonal life\nThao has lived in Oakland during her entire adulthood. She lives with her partner, Andre, and their two children. When she served on the Oakland City Council, she was one of three council members who rented their home. She is the first renter to be elected as Oakland's mayor.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nProfile at Vote Smart\n Media related to Sheng Thao at Wikimedia Commons"

            "wiki_text": "Ignacio De La Fuente (born January 1, 1949) is a former Oakland City Councilmember.  He was also the President of Oakland's City Council until January 2009, when he became vice mayor of Oakland. De La Fuente was an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of Oakland in 1998, 2006, and 2022.\n\nBackground\nDe La Fuente was born in Mexico City, immigrated to California at the age of 21, and subsequently became an American citizen. De La Fuente settled in Oakland, California and began working in a foundry as a machinist.\n\nTrade union representative\nIn 1977 he was elected as a union representative of Phoenix Iron Works.  Today De La Fuente serves as an International Vice President for the Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics, and Allied Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, where he negotiates for members through the collective bargaining process.\n\nOakland City Council\nFirst elected to the Oakland City Council in 1992, he served as the chair of the council's Economic and Community Development Committee until January 1999.  When Oakland adopted the Strong-Mayor form of government, that removed the Mayor from the City Council and created the position of Council President. De La Fuente became the first Council member to be elected by his peers to serve as President of the Oakland City Council in 1999. He has been re-elected to this position every two years since then.\n\nOpposition to medical marijuana movement\nIn 1998, when the Oakland City Council deputized the Oakland Cannabis Buyer's Cooperative to distribute medical marijuana, De La Fuente cast a negative vote, saying that he could not support such efforts in \"good conscience,\" citing concerns over abuse as well as control, certification, and monitoring of caregivers. De La Fuente supported efforts in 2003 to shutter all of Oakland's dispensaries but one, contending that \"at least half of the clubs (were) selling pot for recreational use.\"\n\n2006 mayoral campaign\nDe La Fuente ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Oakland in 2006, placing second of three major candidates, behind the winner (former Congressman Ron Dellums) but ahead of challenger Nancy Nadel. On June 16, 2006, after a careful ballot recount, and a dispute over whether votes for unqualified write-in candidates such as George W. Bush and Homer Simpson counted towards the total, Dellums was declared the winner in the Oakland mayoral race. Dellums garnered the 50.18 percent majority he needed to win the election  This was 155 votes more than needed to avoid a runoff. Dellums received 41,992 votes, while De La Fuente received 27,607 votes, and Nadel 10,928 votes.\n\n2012 at-large city council campaign\nIn 2012 De La Fuente challenged Rebecca Kaplan for the at-large set on the Oakland City Council, leaving open the district 5 seat. De La Fuente lost to Kaplan, while Noel Gallo won the district 5 race to succeed De La Fuente. De La Fuente made false statements during his campaign.\n\n2022 Oakland mayoral campaign\nDe La Fuente ran for Mayor of Oakland in the 2022 Oakland mayoral election. He ran on a \"back to basics\" slogan. His campaign has received most of its funding from coal lobbyists. Other candidates have signed a pledge not to take lobbying money from the coal industry. De La Fuente lost; only receiving about 10% of the vote.\n\nOakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority\nIn January 2017 De La Fuente was appointed to the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority board.\n\nPersonal life\nDe La Fuente lives in Oakland.\nOn October 26, 2007, the councilman's son, Ignacio De La Fuente Jr., was sentenced to fourteen years in prison for the rape of three women, and a 15-year-old girl. The councilman maintains his son's innocence, and claims there was a \"conspiracy\" within the Oakland Police Department to target his son, and publicize the charges, for the purpose of embarrassing the elder De La Fuente during his unsuccessful 2006 mayoral bid. His son pleaded guilty and admitted to the sexual assaults.On December 23, 2010, De La Fuente was arrested for speeding and DUI. A California Highway Patrol officer alleged to have observed De La Fuente speeding around 80 miles per hour (130 km/h) and making unsafe lane changes while driving his 2006 Buick on the Nimitz Freeway, I-880, near the Fruitvale Avenue exit in East Oakland. A CHP spokesperson alleges that, after being stopped, De La Fuente was noticeably impaired and failed field sobriety and driver coordination tests.  He was booked into the North County jail in Downtown Oakland before being released the same evening to the custody of his wife, Elvia. De La Fuente failed a sobriety test and driver coordination tests. Prosecutors, citing a lack of evidence, mainly lack of a blood test to prove his blood alcohol level, declined to seek DUI charges against De La Fuente.\n\n\n== References =="

            "wiki_text": "Ignacio De La Fuente (born January 1, 1949) is a former Oakland City Councilmember.  He was also the President of Oakland's City Council until January 2009, when he became vice mayor of Oakland. De La Fuente was an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of Oakland in 1998, 2006, and 2022.\n\nBackground\nDe La Fuente was born in Mexico City, immigrated to California at the age of 21, and subsequently became an American citizen. De La Fuente settled in Oakland, California and began working in a foundry as a machinist.\n\nTrade union representative\nIn 1977 he was elected as a union representative of Phoenix Iron Works.  Today De La Fuente serves as an International Vice President for the Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics, and Allied Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, where he negotiates for members through the collective bargaining process.\n\nOakland City Council\nFirst elected to the Oakland City Council in 1992, he served as the chair of the council's Economic and Community Development Committee until January 1999.  When Oakland adopted the Strong-Mayor form of government, that removed the Mayor from the City Council and created the position of Council President. De La Fuente became the first Council member to be elected by his peers to serve as President of the Oakland City Council in 1999. He has been re-elected to this position every two years since then.\n\nOpposition to medical marijuana movement\nIn 1998, when the Oakland City Council deputized the Oakland Cannabis Buyer's Cooperative to distribute medical marijuana, De La Fuente cast a negative vote, saying that he could not support such efforts in \"good conscience,\" citing concerns over abuse as well as control, certification, and monitoring of caregivers. De La Fuente supported efforts in 2003 to shutter all of Oakland's dispensaries but one, contending that \"at least half of the clubs (were) selling pot for recreational use.\"\n\n2006 mayoral campaign\nDe La Fuente ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Oakland in 2006, placing second of three major candidates, behind the winner (former Congressman Ron Dellums) but ahead of challenger Nancy Nadel. On June 16, 2006, after a careful ballot recount, and a dispute over whether votes for unqualified write-in candidates such as George W. Bush and Homer Simpson counted towards the total, Dellums was declared the winner in the Oakland mayoral race. Dellums garnered the 50.18 percent majority he needed to win the election  This was 155 votes more than needed to avoid a runoff. Dellums received 41,992 votes, while De La Fuente received 27,607 votes, and Nadel 10,928 votes.\n\n2012 at-large city council campaign\nIn 2012 De La Fuente challenged Rebecca Kaplan for the at-large set on the Oakland City Council, leaving open the district 5 seat. De La Fuente lost to Kaplan, while Noel Gallo won the district 5 race to succeed De La Fuente. De La Fuente made false statements during his campaign.\n\n2022 Oakland mayoral campaign\nDe La Fuente ran for Mayor of Oakland in the 2022 Oakland mayoral election. He ran on a \"back to basics\" slogan. His campaign has received most of its funding from coal lobbyists. Other candidates have signed a pledge not to take lobbying money from the coal industry. De La Fuente lost; only receiving about 10% of the vote.\n\nOakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority\nIn January 2017 De La Fuente was appointed to the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority board.\n\nPersonal life\nDe La Fuente lives in Oakland.\nOn October 26, 2007, the councilman's son, Ignacio De La Fuente Jr., was sentenced to fourteen years in prison for the rape of three women, and a 15-year-old girl. The councilman maintains his son's innocence, and claims there was a \"conspiracy\" within the Oakland Police Department to target his son, and publicize the charges, for the purpose of embarrassing the elder De La Fuente during his unsuccessful 2006 mayoral bid. His son pleaded guilty and admitted to the sexual assaults.On December 23, 2010, De La Fuente was arrested for speeding and DUI. A California Highway Patrol officer alleged to have observed De La Fuente speeding around 80 miles per hour (130 km/h) and making unsafe lane changes while driving his 2006 Buick on the Nimitz Freeway, I-880, near the Fruitvale Avenue exit in East Oakland. A CHP spokesperson alleges that, after being stopped, De La Fuente was noticeably impaired and failed field sobriety and driver coordination tests.  He was booked into the North County jail in Downtown Oakland before being released the same evening to the custody of his wife, Elvia. De La Fuente failed a sobriety test and driver coordination tests. Prosecutors, citing a lack of evidence, mainly lack of a blood test to prove his blood alcohol level, declined to seek DUI charges against De La Fuente.\n\n\n== References =="

Tell us about yourself.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tGod tasked Peter Yuan Liu to bring world peace in 2003 at Ziggurat of Ur, Iraq. Self-made multimillionaire, 100% service-connected Army combat veteran, on mission to create United States University Online run by U.S. Dept. of Education, Bachelors degree level for $400, Masters for $600 and Doctorates for $800. Once mastering the subjects, apply to $500 Doctorate level testing that if passed with 70%+ gets Bachelors Degree with a license to practice in their trade, 85%+ for Masters, 95%+ Doctorate. University available worldwide, profits distributed back to the taxpayers as dividends, etc. All H1B VISA seekers must pass the exam, eliminating fake diploma mills, provide degree pathway using work experience/training and/or if college/university went bankrupt and/or lost accreditation. Liu, federally recognized journalist by the DINFOS, deemed too honest, blacklisted by Twitter, Facebook and #fakenews mass media even though he ranked 10th out of 27 candidates in the 2018 California gubernatorial primary with zero monetary contributions. Liu's Community Empowered Safety Plan brings peace and #CESP5 riches to his followers worldwide, making Ivy League Universities such as Harvard, Yale, like 56K modems in age of wireless 5G.

For every person caught with an illegal gun (stolen, serial scratched off, ineligible felon, etc.) obtain search warrants ASAP for their residences to get more illegal guns, find fingerprints on those guns, match in FBI databases for suspect straw purchasers for more potential arrests.\n3. Install mandatory surveillance in medium and high crime areas. Surveillance footage will be accessible real time via internet to lawful city residents with login and password.\n4. New policing strategy involve more community participation. Each officer will setup and advise a neighborhood watch that has about 7 to 25 volunteer members led by a team leader voted by the members. They will meet once a month to discuss issues affecting the neighborhood and the officer will be present as needed to give advice. Once the city declares an emergency, all neighborhood volunteers will be notified to prepare for best course of action to protect themselves or neighborhood which includes evacuation orders.\n5. Start a business center to teach small businesses entrepreneurship to city residents.

Tell us about yourself.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tI am Tyron Jordan and I am running as a true progressive in the race for Mayor of Oakland. I served as a Senator Bernie Sanders delegate-at-large at the Democratic National Convention in 2020, I am a former shop steward/ union organizer for SEIU local 1000, a former Mayoral appointee, and a military veteran. In addition, I serve on the Board of Directors of a West Oakland based non-profit.\r\nI was born in Ventura, California but lived most of the time in Northern California. I moved to Oakland in 2009.  I attended Fairfield High School, where I was a track and field standout; and I am currently an avid marathon runner. I am an avid reader; primarily of history and biography.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPlease list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\nReduce Homelessness to a point where it is a rarity\nRevitalize Small Business\nMaintain Public Safety without criminalizing homelessness, mental illness or substance abuse\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhat areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tI feel that the homelessness situation is at a crisis level. Having individuals and families, living in tents, under bridges and parks; is unacceptable at every level. Providing more shelters have  become a “permanent “ solution. What is needed for unhoused people to thrive and to fully participate in their communities; is permanent safe steady housing.\n\n   Despite misconceptions; a significant number of those who are unhoused, are employed. The soaring cost of housing has made it impossible to afford.  The common approach of letting developers come in, with the promise of providing a percentage of affordable units; must be re-examined. This approach has proven  to be ineffective.\r\n In the situation of the unhoused, who are struggling with mental health issues/ drug abuse; they need stable housing along with a strong social support systems. The Housing First approach, along with treatment have been tried and successful in many cities. When I moved to Oakland in 2009, one of the top issues was the increasing level of homelessness\r\n\nIn 2022, the top issue remains to be the increasing level of homelessness. In that span of time, City Council members have come and gone, and Mayors have come and gone. It is time to take a serious comprehensive approach to help people get off the streets, and help them utilize their talents and potential. Such  a step would benefit us all. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWho do you look up to?

Jerry Brown signed legislation Padilla sponsored in the state Senate banning single-use plastic bags at grocery store checkouts in the state of California.[28] Padilla, a nominee for the open secretary of state seat in the 2014 elections, faced ads opposing him in the months prior to the bill's approval.[29][28]\n\nTop-two primary system\nPadilla, running for California Secretary of State in 2014 on the promise of free and fair elections, expressed concern over the ballot access limitations affecting minor parties due to new requirements implemented in 2012 with the top-two primary system. Under those new qualifications, minor party candidates must collect 10,000 signatures to waive a filing fee equal to two percent of the first year's salary for state offices or one percent for members of Congress. Prior to implementing the top-two system, the number of signatures required to waive that fee was 150, so most minor parties opted to file petitions. Senator Padilla's office said in February 2014 it was looking into legislative solutions to improve ballot access for minor parties.[30][31]\n\n\nPrimary election background\nInformation about the race background can be found by clicking [show] at the right. \nPrimary election\nStances on top-two primary system\nOne of the key issues of the 2014 secretary of state primary was the signature and filing requirements for minor party candidates under California's top-two primary system. Under new qualifications implemented with the top-two primary system, minor party candidates must collect 10,000 signatures to waive a filing fee equal to 2 percent of the first year's salary for state offices or 1 percent for members of Congress. Prior to implementing the top-two system, the number of signatures required to waive that fee was 150, so most minor parties opted to file petitions. \nAfter launching their campaigns for California Secretary of State, California State Senator Alex Padilla (D) and ex-state Sen. Leland Yee (D), who ultimately had to withdraw from the race after he was arrested in March 2014, expressed concerns about ballot access limitations for minor parties under the top-two primary system. Yee opposed the top-two system during his time in the California State Senate and Senator Padilla said his office was looking into legislative solutions.[32][33] Green Party candidate David Scott Curtis campaigned against the top-two system while independent candidate Dan Schnur, who was designated \"no party preference\" on the ballot since California’s Proposition 14 took away candidates' \"independent\" label option, was in favor of the system. Democrat Derek Cressman openly opposed the system but did not focus on the issue during his campaign. \nAlso in the race, Democrat Jeff Drobman and two Republicans, Pete Peterson and Roy Allmond, had not made their stances on the top-two system known prior to the primary. \n\nCandidates excluded from debate\nA California non-profit association called the Sacramento Press Club incited the ire of Green Party candidate David Scott Curtis after failing to invite him and two other 2014 secretary of state candidates to participate in an April 23 debate.[34] With seven candidates in the running, the Sacramento Press Club said they wanted to restrict the size of the event by only including \"top contenders in a crowded field,\" whom they determined to be Pete Peterson (R), state Sen. Alex Padilla (D), Dan Schnur (I) and Derek Cressman (D). By the time Curtis learned of his exclusion, back-to-back Field Polls had been released showing Curtis ahead of both Schnur and Cressman. Absent an immediate explanation or apology from the Sacramento Press Club, Curtis used social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to broadcast his outrage over what he considered a conspicuous display of political bias by the tax-exempt organization. Curtis also filed an IRS investigation request related to the group's tax-exempt status.[35] A press club representative characterized Curtis's actions as a \"tirade of insulting and threatening social media posts\" against the organization. The Green Party hopeful questioned what such selectivity meant for the state of 'journalism' in an attempt to highlight the significance of the snub. Curtis also noted that some of the major-party candidates were already known for courting media attention. Schnur was known for furnishing the Capitol press, whose members make up a large portion of the Sacramento Press Club, with sound bites and other material. Schnur was one of the two candidates to receive invitations to the debate hosted by the press club despite trailing Curtis in the polls. Joe Mathews, the California editor at Zocalo Public Square, wrote, “Of course, I’m for Dan Schnur for Secretary of State. I’m in the media, and he’s our candidate...He’s the favored candidate of our state’s political media, which feeds us polls and old, bogus narratives about the state.”[34] Meanwhile, Northern California's chapter of The Society of Professional Journalists honored Leland Yee with its Public Official Award shortly before Yee's arrest forced him to exit the race.[34]\n\nYee Arrest\nOn March 26, 2014, Democratic candidate Leland Yee was arraigned on seven charges of corruption and firearms trafficking. Yee, along with 25 others, was involved in an FBI operation to uncover those suspected of illegal activities involving drugs, guns and arranging murder for hire. Yee's alleged illegal activities stemmed from his debt acquired in a failed run for San Francisco mayor in 2011 and money raised for the Secretary of State race. Authorities believed Yee accepted money for official actions performed while in office. These actions included urging an agency to accept a software contract from a specific vendor in exchange for $10,000, writing a Senate proclamation to honor the Chee Kung Tong group for $6,800 and introducing a medical marijuana businessman to state legislators working on the issue for $21,000. Unknown to Yee, all of these paying contacts were undercover agents. In other attempts to raise money, Yee allegedly promised to help other undercover agents obtain illegal guns from an international arms dealer.[36]\nDespite no longer being in the race, Yee's name remained on the primary ballot.\n\n\n\n2010\nSee also: California State Senate elections, 2010\nPadilla won re-election to the 20th District seat in 2010.

Its purpose is to inform voters about the legislator’s political positions. Because scorecards have varying purposes and methodologies, each report should be considered on its own merits. For example, an advocacy group’s scorecard may assess a legislator’s voting record on one issue while a state newspaper’s scorecard may evaluate the voting record in its entirety.\nBallotpedia is in the process of developing an encyclopedic list of published scorecards.

            "wiki_text": "Alejandro \"Alex\" Padilla (born March 22, 1973) is an American politician serving as the senior United States senator from California, a seat he has held since 2021. A member of the Democratic Party, Padilla served as the 30th secretary of state of California from 2015 to 2021 and was a member of the California State Senate and the Los Angeles City Council.Governor Gavin Newsom appointed Padilla to the United States Senate after then-Senator Kamala Harris was elected Vice President of the United States; Harris, as the newly elected vice president and president of the Senate, swore Padilla in on January 20, 2021. In dual November 2022 elections, Padilla won a special election to complete Harris's term as well as election to a full Senate term, defeating Republican nominee Mark Meuser in both.Padilla became California's senior senator on September 29, 2023, upon the death of Dianne Feinstein.\n\nEarly life and education\nPadilla is one of three children of Santos and Lupe Padilla, both of whom immigrated from Mexico, specifically Jalisco and Chihuahua, before meeting and marrying in Los Angeles, where he was born. He grew up in Pacoima, Los Angeles, and graduated from San Fernando High School in the northeast San Fernando Valley. He earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1994. He graduated from the Coro Fellows Southern California Program in 1995.\n\nEarly career\nLos Angeles\nAfter graduation, Padilla moved back to Pacoima and briefly worked as an engineer for Hughes Aircraft, where he wrote software for satellite systems.Padilla is a former member of the governing board of MIT and president of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO), which has a membership of more than 6,000 Latino U.S. officials. He has chaired the Los Angeles Leadership Council for the American Diabetes Association since 2005.Padilla began in politics as a member of the Democratic Party in 1995, in substantial part in response to California Proposition 187, which excluded illegal immigrants from all non-emergency public services, including public education, but which he felt was motivated by a broader nativism that demonized legal and illegal immigrants alike. His first professional role was as a personal assistant to Senator Dianne Feinstein. He then served as a campaign manager for Assemblyman Tony Cárdenas in 1996, Assemblyman Gil Cedillo in 1997, and State Senator Richard Alarcon in 1998, all Democrats. All won their respective elections.\n\nLos Angeles City Council\nOn July 1, 1999, at age 26, Padilla was sworn in as a member of the Los Angeles City Council. Two years later, his colleagues elected him council president. Padilla was the first Latino and the youngest person elected president of the Los Angeles City Council, defeating incumbent Ruth Galanter. On September 13, 2001, two days after the 9/11 attacks, Padilla became the acting mayor of Los Angeles for a couple of days while Mayor James K. Hahn traveled out of the city. Los Angeles Times wrote that Padilla's rise to the mayor's office raised his \"political stock\".During his term as City Council president, Padilla also was elected president of the California League of Cities, the first Latino to serve in that position.\n\nCalifornia State Senate\nAfter retiring as president of the Los Angeles City Council, Padilla was elected to the State Senate in 2006, defeating Libertarian Pamela Brown. He was reelected in 2010 with nearly 70% of the vote over Republican Kathleen Evans. Padilla served as a member of the Appropriations Committee, Business and Professions and Economic Development Committee, Governmental Organization Committee, Labor and Industrial Relations Committee, and chaired the Select Committee on Science, Innovation and Public Policy. He left office on November 30, 2014, after two terms.In August 2012, Padilla was included in a list of 20 Latino political rising stars compiled by the San Francisco Chronicle, citing his role in the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.In September 2014, Padilla promoted what would later become Proposition 67, a proposed ban on plastic bags. On November 8, 2016, when Padilla was Secretary of State, the proposal was voted on in a referendum, and the option in favor of the ban on plastic bags received 53% of the vote. Padilla authored legislation that passed in 2008 requiring some restaurants to disclose calorie information on menus.\n\n30th Secretary of State of California (2015–2021)\nOn April 11, 2013, Padilla announced his intention to run for California secretary of state in 2014, to succeed the term-limited Debra Bowen. He was expected to face an intraparty battle with fellow Democrat Leland Yee, but Yee's arrest for felony racketeering caused Yee to abandon the race. Padilla won the election on November 4, 2014, with 53.6% of the vote, defeating Republican Pete Peterson.On June 29, 2017, the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which President Donald Trump created on May 11, requested data on enrolled voters from every state, dating back to 2006. Padilla said that California would not supply the data.On November 6, 2018, Padilla was reelected with 64.5% of the vote, defeating Republican Mark P. Meuser.On October 16, 2020, Padilla was involved in a controversy between the state and the California Republican Party, as the party deployed unofficial ballot boxes for voters to submit their ballots at select locations, including churches and gun stores in competitive California districts. Padilla issued a cease-and-desist order, arguing that the ballot boxes were illegal and failed to ensure ballot security. Local Republican leadership refused to follow the order and said the boxes were a form of legal ballot harvesting that had been enabled by recent Democratic legislation (which lacked a chain of custody requirement), and were a way to increase voter turnout. Accusing Democrats of hypocrisy given their widespread door-to-door ballot harvesting in the 2018 United States elections, the state Republican Party later agreed to a set of collection procedures and said a volunteer's mistake of affixing a sign denoting the ballot box as \"official\" had contributed to the political standoff; Padilla's office said it was continuing to investigate whether ballots were being handled correctly and that the \"ineptitude or unlawfulness of a political operative or campaign volunteer\" could nonetheless lead to \"serious legal consequences\".In early 2020, Padilla announced a $35 million no-bid contract for a statewide voter education ad campaign with partisan public relations firm SKDK (then known as \"SKDKnickerbocker\") called \"Vote Safe California\", but State Controller Betty Yee blocked the funding because Padilla's office did not have the authority to use federal money that was allocated to county governments; the campaign proceeded anyway. The group had marketed itself as being on \"Team Biden\", and the awarding of the no-bid contract under supposed \"emergency powers\" despite the group's ties with the Democratic Party and work for Democratic politicians running for office in California received bipartisan criticism. Amid ongoing litigation by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, who contend that the contract bypassed fair competition rules and misappropriated federal election funding for local elections operations, and was therefore illegal, Governor Newsom signed legislation that provided state funding to reimburse SKDK in February 2021.Upon Padilla's appointment to the U.S. Senate, Newsom appointed Assemblywoman Shirley Weber to succeed him.\n\nUnited States Senator from California (2021–present)\nAppointment\nIn August 2020, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden selected California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. After they won the general election, Padilla was mentioned as a possible choice as Harris's successor in the Senate. Governor Newsom had the power to appoint her successor. In December 2020, Newsom announced that he would appoint Padilla to the seat, making him California's first Hispanic senator and the first male U.S. senator from California since Alan Cranston retired in 1993. During the speculation about whom Newsom would appoint, the senior senator from California, Dianne Feinstein, supported Padilla. To replace Padilla as California's secretary of state, Newsom appointed state assemblywoman Shirley Weber.Most Latinos, who are 40% of California's population, supported Padilla's appointment, but some black leaders, who wanted another black woman to replace Harris, criticized it. San Francisco Mayor London Breed called Padilla's appointment \"a real blow to the African American community\".\n\nElections\n2022\nPadilla announced that he would seek a full term in 2022. He appeared on two ballots: one for the special election to fill the remainder of his term in the 117th Congress, and the other for the new term beginning with the 118th Congress. The special election was due to a recent change in California law that ended Padilla's appointment in November 2022. He was on the ballot in two separate races in the November 2022 election—a special election for the final two months of Harris's Senate term, and a regular election for a full six-year term beginning in January 2023.\n\nTenure\nOn January 20, 2021, Padilla was sworn into the United States Senate in the 117th Congress by Vice President Kamala Harris, his predecessor, becoming the first Latino to represent California in the U.S. Senate. He was sworn in by Vice President Harris on her first day, at the same time as new Georgia senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. He served the final two years of Harris's term. He filed the necessary paperwork with the FEC to run for a full term and an unexpired term in the 2022 elections which he won in November 2022.\nWhile in office, Padilla introduced legislation to add more legal protections for various public lands in California, including parts of the San Gabriel Mountains,  Los Padres National Forest, and Carrizo Plain National Monument. Padilla also introduced legislation to help coastal communities adapt shorelines to increased flooding and erosion from sea level rise and extreme weather.\n\nCommittee assignments\nCommittee on the Judiciary\nSubcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety (Chairman)\nCommittee on the Budget\nCommittee on Environment and Public Works\nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\nCommittee on Rules and Administration\n\nCaucus memberships\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus\nSenate Cultural Caucus\nCongressional Asian Pacific American Caucus\nRare Disease Caucus\n\nPolitical positions\nThe Wall Street Journal says that Padilla had \"a reputation [in the State Senate] as a business-friendly moderate\". FiveThirtyEight defined him as a technocrat, not identified with either the progressive or the moderate wing of the party. The American Conservative Union gave Padilla a 0% rating in 2012. On January 18, 2021, Padilla released a statement in support of the Green New Deal and Medicare For All legislation, among other progressive policies.\n\nAbortion\nPadilla favors abortion rights, saying in 2018 that abortion rights are \"not negotiable\". In 2008, Padilla sponsored the bill SB 1770, which would require the Commission on Peace Officer Standards Training (POST) to prepare relevant guidelines and mechanisms for the investigation and reporting of \"cases involving anti-reproductive-rights crimes\". In 2018, after winning the primary for secretary of state to seek a second term, he received support from NARAL Pro-Choice America.When Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, Padilla condemned the decision.\n\nLGBTQIA+ rights\nPadilla supports transgender rights.\n\nClimate and environment\nPadilla supports climate action and said during budgetary discussions in October 2021 that \"[c]limate cannot be on the chopping block in this or any budget.\" He supports the Green New Deal and has said that it \"offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity.\" Padilla received a 100% score from the League of Conservation Voters in 2021.\n\nFilibuster\nPadilla supports ending the Senate filibuster.\n\nImmigration\nPadilla supports immigrants' rights. On January 15, 2021, he said that he supports legislation sponsored by representative Joaquin Castro to speed up the citizenship process for undocumented immigrants in essential jobs, declaring that because of the work they do, \"they deserve stability\".\n\nVoting rights\nPadilla has been known for efforts to expand voting access. When he was appointed to the Senate in 2021, Newsom called him \"a national defender of voting rights\".\n\nPersonal life\nPadilla married Angela Monzon in 2012. They have three sons and live in the San Fernando Valley's Porter Ranch neighborhood. In late 2015 and early 2016, the Aliso Canyon gas leak temporarily displaced the Padillas from their home.\n\nElectoral history\nSee also\nList of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the United States Congress\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nSenator Alex Padilla official U.S. Senate website\nAlex Padilla for Senate campaign website\nAppearances on C-SPANBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart"

            "wiki_text": "Alejandro \"Alex\" Padilla (born March 22, 1973) is an American politician serving as the senior United States senator from California, a seat he has held since 2021. A member of the Democratic Party, Padilla served as the 30th secretary of state of California from 2015 to 2021 and was a member of the California State Senate and the Los Angeles City Council.Governor Gavin Newsom appointed Padilla to the United States Senate after then-Senator Kamala Harris was elected Vice President of the United States; Harris, as the newly elected vice president and president of the Senate, swore Padilla in on January 20, 2021. In dual November 2022 elections, Padilla won a special election to complete Harris's term as well as election to a full Senate term, defeating Republican nominee Mark Meuser in both.Padilla became California's senior senator on September 29, 2023, upon the death of Dianne Feinstein.\n\nEarly life and education\nPadilla is one of three children of Santos and Lupe Padilla, both of whom immigrated from Mexico, specifically Jalisco and Chihuahua, before meeting and marrying in Los Angeles, where he was born. He grew up in Pacoima, Los Angeles, and graduated from San Fernando High School in the northeast San Fernando Valley. He earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1994. He graduated from the Coro Fellows Southern California Program in 1995.\n\nEarly career\nLos Angeles\nAfter graduation, Padilla moved back to Pacoima and briefly worked as an engineer for Hughes Aircraft, where he wrote software for satellite systems.Padilla is a former member of the governing board of MIT and president of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO), which has a membership of more than 6,000 Latino U.S. officials. He has chaired the Los Angeles Leadership Council for the American Diabetes Association since 2005.Padilla began in politics as a member of the Democratic Party in 1995, in substantial part in response to California Proposition 187, which excluded illegal immigrants from all non-emergency public services, including public education, but which he felt was motivated by a broader nativism that demonized legal and illegal immigrants alike. His first professional role was as a personal assistant to Senator Dianne Feinstein. He then served as a campaign manager for Assemblyman Tony Cárdenas in 1996, Assemblyman Gil Cedillo in 1997, and State Senator Richard Alarcon in 1998, all Democrats. All won their respective elections.\n\nLos Angeles City Council\nOn July 1, 1999, at age 26, Padilla was sworn in as a member of the Los Angeles City Council. Two years later, his colleagues elected him council president. Padilla was the first Latino and the youngest person elected president of the Los Angeles City Council, defeating incumbent Ruth Galanter. On September 13, 2001, two days after the 9/11 attacks, Padilla became the acting mayor of Los Angeles for a couple of days while Mayor James K. Hahn traveled out of the city. Los Angeles Times wrote that Padilla's rise to the mayor's office raised his \"political stock\".During his term as City Council president, Padilla also was elected president of the California League of Cities, the first Latino to serve in that position.\n\nCalifornia State Senate\nAfter retiring as president of the Los Angeles City Council, Padilla was elected to the State Senate in 2006, defeating Libertarian Pamela Brown. He was reelected in 2010 with nearly 70% of the vote over Republican Kathleen Evans. Padilla served as a member of the Appropriations Committee, Business and Professions and Economic Development Committee, Governmental Organization Committee, Labor and Industrial Relations Committee, and chaired the Select Committee on Science, Innovation and Public Policy. He left office on November 30, 2014, after two terms.In August 2012, Padilla was included in a list of 20 Latino political rising stars compiled by the San Francisco Chronicle, citing his role in the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.In September 2014, Padilla promoted what would later become Proposition 67, a proposed ban on plastic bags. On November 8, 2016, when Padilla was Secretary of State, the proposal was voted on in a referendum, and the option in favor of the ban on plastic bags received 53% of the vote. Padilla authored legislation that passed in 2008 requiring some restaurants to disclose calorie information on menus.\n\n30th Secretary of State of California (2015–2021)\nOn April 11, 2013, Padilla announced his intention to run for California secretary of state in 2014, to succeed the term-limited Debra Bowen. He was expected to face an intraparty battle with fellow Democrat Leland Yee, but Yee's arrest for felony racketeering caused Yee to abandon the race. Padilla won the election on November 4, 2014, with 53.6% of the vote, defeating Republican Pete Peterson.On June 29, 2017, the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which President Donald Trump created on May 11, requested data on enrolled voters from every state, dating back to 2006. Padilla said that California would not supply the data.On November 6, 2018, Padilla was reelected with 64.5% of the vote, defeating Republican Mark P. Meuser.On October 16, 2020, Padilla was involved in a controversy between the state and the California Republican Party, as the party deployed unofficial ballot boxes for voters to submit their ballots at select locations, including churches and gun stores in competitive California districts. Padilla issued a cease-and-desist order, arguing that the ballot boxes were illegal and failed to ensure ballot security. Local Republican leadership refused to follow the order and said the boxes were a form of legal ballot harvesting that had been enabled by recent Democratic legislation (which lacked a chain of custody requirement), and were a way to increase voter turnout. Accusing Democrats of hypocrisy given their widespread door-to-door ballot harvesting in the 2018 United States elections, the state Republican Party later agreed to a set of collection procedures and said a volunteer's mistake of affixing a sign denoting the ballot box as \"official\" had contributed to the political standoff; Padilla's office said it was continuing to investigate whether ballots were being handled correctly and that the \"ineptitude or unlawfulness of a political operative or campaign volunteer\" could nonetheless lead to \"serious legal consequences\".In early 2020, Padilla announced a $35 million no-bid contract for a statewide voter education ad campaign with partisan public relations firm SKDK (then known as \"SKDKnickerbocker\") called \"Vote Safe California\", but State Controller Betty Yee blocked the funding because Padilla's office did not have the authority to use federal money that was allocated to county governments; the campaign proceeded anyway. The group had marketed itself as being on \"Team Biden\", and the awarding of the no-bid contract under supposed \"emergency powers\" despite the group's ties with the Democratic Party and work for Democratic politicians running for office in California received bipartisan criticism. Amid ongoing litigation by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, who contend that the contract bypassed fair competition rules and misappropriated federal election funding for local elections operations, and was therefore illegal, Governor Newsom signed legislation that provided state funding to reimburse SKDK in February 2021.Upon Padilla's appointment to the U.S. Senate, Newsom appointed Assemblywoman Shirley Weber to succeed him.\n\nUnited States Senator from California (2021–present)\nAppointment\nIn August 2020, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden selected California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. After they won the general election, Padilla was mentioned as a possible choice as Harris's successor in the Senate. Governor Newsom had the power to appoint her successor. In December 2020, Newsom announced that he would appoint Padilla to the seat, making him California's first Hispanic senator and the first male U.S. senator from California since Alan Cranston retired in 1993. During the speculation about whom Newsom would appoint, the senior senator from California, Dianne Feinstein, supported Padilla. To replace Padilla as California's secretary of state, Newsom appointed state assemblywoman Shirley Weber.Most Latinos, who are 40% of California's population, supported Padilla's appointment, but some black leaders, who wanted another black woman to replace Harris, criticized it. San Francisco Mayor London Breed called Padilla's appointment \"a real blow to the African American community\".\n\nElections\n2022\nPadilla announced that he would seek a full term in 2022. He appeared on two ballots: one for the special election to fill the remainder of his term in the 117th Congress, and the other for the new term beginning with the 118th Congress. The special election was due to a recent change in California law that ended Padilla's appointment in November 2022. He was on the ballot in two separate races in the November 2022 election—a special election for the final two months of Harris's Senate term, and a regular election for a full six-year term beginning in January 2023.\n\nTenure\nOn January 20, 2021, Padilla was sworn into the United States Senate in the 117th Congress by Vice President Kamala Harris, his predecessor, becoming the first Latino to represent California in the U.S. Senate. He was sworn in by Vice President Harris on her first day, at the same time as new Georgia senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. He served the final two years of Harris's term. He filed the necessary paperwork with the FEC to run for a full term and an unexpired term in the 2022 elections which he won in November 2022.\nWhile in office, Padilla introduced legislation to add more legal protections for various public lands in California, including parts of the San Gabriel Mountains,  Los Padres National Forest, and Carrizo Plain National Monument. Padilla also introduced legislation to help coastal communities adapt shorelines to increased flooding and erosion from sea level rise and extreme weather.\n\nCommittee assignments\nCommittee on the Judiciary\nSubcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety (Chairman)\nCommittee on the Budget\nCommittee on Environment and Public Works\nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\nCommittee on Rules and Administration\n\nCaucus memberships\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus\nSenate Cultural Caucus\nCongressional Asian Pacific American Caucus\nRare Disease Caucus\n\nPolitical positions\nThe Wall Street Journal says that Padilla had \"a reputation [in the State Senate] as a business-friendly moderate\". FiveThirtyEight defined him as a technocrat, not identified with either the progressive or the moderate wing of the party. The American Conservative Union gave Padilla a 0% rating in 2012. On January 18, 2021, Padilla released a statement in support of the Green New Deal and Medicare For All legislation, among other progressive policies.\n\nAbortion\nPadilla favors abortion rights, saying in 2018 that abortion rights are \"not negotiable\". In 2008, Padilla sponsored the bill SB 1770, which would require the Commission on Peace Officer Standards Training (POST) to prepare relevant guidelines and mechanisms for the investigation and reporting of \"cases involving anti-reproductive-rights crimes\". In 2018, after winning the primary for secretary of state to seek a second term, he received support from NARAL Pro-Choice America.When Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, Padilla condemned the decision.\n\nLGBTQIA+ rights\nPadilla supports transgender rights.\n\nClimate and environment\nPadilla supports climate action and said during budgetary discussions in October 2021 that \"[c]limate cannot be on the chopping block in this or any budget.\" He supports the Green New Deal and has said that it \"offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity.\" Padilla received a 100% score from the League of Conservation Voters in 2021.\n\nFilibuster\nPadilla supports ending the Senate filibuster.\n\nImmigration\nPadilla supports immigrants' rights. On January 15, 2021, he said that he supports legislation sponsored by representative Joaquin Castro to speed up the citizenship process for undocumented immigrants in essential jobs, declaring that because of the work they do, \"they deserve stability\".\n\nVoting rights\nPadilla has been known for efforts to expand voting access. When he was appointed to the Senate in 2021, Newsom called him \"a national defender of voting rights\".\n\nPersonal life\nPadilla married Angela Monzon in 2012. They have three sons and live in the San Fernando Valley's Porter Ranch neighborhood. In late 2015 and early 2016, the Aliso Canyon gas leak temporarily displaced the Padillas from their home.\n\nElectoral history\nSee also\nList of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the United States Congress\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nSenator Alex Padilla official U.S. Senate website\nAlex Padilla for Senate campaign website\nAppearances on C-SPANBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart"

Proposition 23 would have required chronic dialysis clinics to: have an on-site physician while patients are being treated; report data on dialysis-related infections; obtain consent from the state health department before closing a clinic; and not discriminate against patients based on the source of payment for care.[2]\nIn 2018,  SEIU-UHW also sponsored Proposition 8, which was defeated with 59.9% of voters rejecting it. Proposition 8 would have required dialysis clinics to issue refunds to patients or patients' payers for revenue above 115% of the costs of direct patient care and healthcare improvements.[3]\n\nWho supported and opposed Proposition 29?\nSee also: Support and Opposition\nCalifornians for Kidney Dialysis Patient Protection led the Kidney Patients Deserve Better campaign in support of Proposition 29. SEIU-UHW West was the primary sponsor and contributed over $7.97 million to the support committee. David Miller, research director of SEIU-UHW, said, \"There’s just so much improvement that can be made, and there’s plenty of resources in the industry to make those improvements. That’s the tension: there’s enormous profitability, then you meet folks of enormous need, and you realize that some of that money should be diverted to patient care.\"[4]\nStop Yet Another Dangerous Dialysis Proposition led the campaign in opposition to Proposition 29. The committee reported nearly $74.6 million in contributions from DaVita Inc. and Fresenius Medical Care. The initiative was also opposed by the Republican Party of California, California Chamber of Commerce, and California Medical Association. The campaign said, \"Since 2012, UHW has wasted $77.7 million of its members’ dues money funding 48 failed ballot initiatives across the country – many of which put patients and their members at risk. That amounts to more than $700 per UHW member that they’ve wasted on these failed and reckless efforts. This is the third ballot measure since 2018 sponsored by UHW targeting dialysis providers. Voters rejected Prop 8 in 2018 by 60% and Prop 23 in 2020 by 63%. It’s shameful that this union would continue to use vulnerable patients as pawns to advance their political agenda.\"[5]\n\nText of measure\nThe ballot title was as follows:[6]\n\n\n\n“\n\n\nRequires on-site Licensed Medical Professional at Kidney Dialysis Clinics and Establishes Other State Requirements. Initiative Statute.[7]\n\n\n”\n\n\nPetition summary\nThe summary provided for inclusion on signature petition sheets was as follows:[6]\n\n\n\n“\n\n\nRequires physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant, with six months’ relevant experience, on site during treatment at outpatient kidney dialysis clinics; authorizes exemption for staffing shortage if qualified medical professional is available through telehealth. Requires clinics to disclose to patients all physicians with clinic ownership interests of five percent or more. Requires clinics to report dialysis-related infection data to state. Prohibits clinics from closing or substantially reducing services without state approval.

The average profit margin for DaVita and Fresenius clinics in the United States is 16% and 15.8% respectively — nearly six times as high as the average profit margin for US hospitals.\" \nDavid Miller, research director of SEIU-UHW: \"There’s just so much improvement that can be made, and there’s plenty of resources in the industry to make those improvements. That’s the tension: there’s enormous profitability, then you meet folks of enormous need, and you realize that some of that money should be diverted to patient care.\" \n\n\nOfficial arguments\nThe following is the argument in support of Proposition 29 found in the Official Voter Information Guide:[9]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Voter Information Guide: Life-Saving Changes for Dialysis Patients\n\nThree times every week, 80,000 Californians with End Stage Renal Disease go to one of more than 600 commercial dialysis centers in the state where they spend several hours connected to a machine that removes their blood, cleans it, and returns it to their bodies. Dialysis literally is what keeps them alive, and they must continue the treatment for the rest of their lives or until they receive a kidney transplant.\n\nBecause the lives of these fellow Californians are so dependent on dialysis done both safely and effectively, we must give our absolute support to the Protect the Lives of Dialysis Patients Act on the Nov. 8 ballot. This initiative makes common-sense improvements to dialysis treatment to protect some of the most medically vulnerable Californians.\n\nThe initiative does five major things:\n\nFirst, it requires a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant to be in the clinic whenever patients are being treated, which is not currently required. Dialysis is a dangerous procedure, and if something goes wrong, a doctor or highly trained clinician should be nearby.\n\nSecond, as dialysis patients are prone to infections that can lead to more serious illnesses or even death, it requires clinics to report data on infections to the state so problems can be identified and solved to better protect patients.\n\nThird, as life-saving health care facilities, it requires dialysis corporations to get approval from the state before closing clinics or reducing services. This will protect access to dialysis treatment, particularly for patients in rural communities.\n\nFourth, it prohibits clinics from discriminating against patients because of their type of insurance and protects patients in every clinic. Whether in a wealthy neighborhood or a poor, rural, Black or Brown community, all clinics will be required to have a doctor or other highly trained clinician on-site and to report their infection rates, and all dialysis corporations will be prohibited from discriminating against patients based on insurance type.\n\nFifth, it increases transparency and helps patients make informed decisions for their care by requiring clinics and dialysis corporations to disclose information on ownership. As joint ventures between dialysis clinics and doctors become more common, improved transparency is needed to allow stakeholders and policy makers to study the effects of physician ownership.\n\nDon’t fall for big dialysis corporations’ claims that this initiative will create huge new costs, harm patients, or create a shortage of doctors—those fake arguments are just designed as scare tactics in their dishonest public relations campaign. The fact is these corporations can easily make these changes and still profit hundreds of millions of dollars a year without disrupting our healthcare system.\n\nProposition 29 will make the changes we need to truly protect dialysis patients. We urge you to vote YES!\n\n--- Emanuel Gonzales, Dialysis Patient Care Technician; Reverend Kisheen W. Tulloss, President, The Baptist Ministers Conference of Los Angeles; and Cecilia Gomez-Gonzalez, Dialysis Patient Advocate \n\n\n\nOpposition\nStop Yet Another Dangerous Dialysis Proposition led the campaign in opposition to Proposition 29.[10]\n\nOpponents\n\n\nPolitical Parties\n\n\n\nRepublican Party of California\n\n\n\nOrganizations\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Academy of Nephrology PAs\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Medical Association\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Taxpayer Protection Committee\n\n\n\n\nNational Hispanic Medical Association\n\n\nArguments\n\n\nOfficial arguments\nThe following is the argument in opposition to Proposition 29 found in the Official Voter Information Guide:[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Voter Information Guide: DIALYSIS PATIENTS STRONGLY OPPOSE PROP. 29 BECAUSE IT PUTS OUR LIVES AT RISK\n\n\"This is the third time a special interest has placed a proposition on the ballot putting my life and the lives of 80,000 other dialysis patients at risk. Twice, voters have overwhelmingly rejected these dangerous propositions. Please, reject Prop. 29 to stop yet another dangerous dialysis proposition.\"—Angel De Los Santos, dialysis patient, Los Angeles\n\n\"I’ve been on dialysis for two years. Dialysis is literally my life support. I am so angry that one special interest is pushing a third proposition that puts my life at risk. Please, protect patients like me . . . again. Vote NO on 29.\"—Rachel Sprinkle-Strong, dialysis patient, Sacramento\n\nPROP. 29 WOULD FORCE COMMUNITY DIALYSIS CLINICS TO CUT SERVICES OR SHUT DOWN—RISKING PATIENTS’ LIVES\n\nDialysis patients, nurses and doctors strongly oppose Prop. 29. More than 80,000 Californians with failed kidneys need dialysis treatments three days a week to stay alive. Missing even a single dialysis treatment increases patients’ risk of death by 30%.\n\nProposition 29 would force dialysis clinics to have new administrators on-site at all times—even though they would not provide direct patient care. This unnecessary requirement would cost hundreds of millions every year, forcing dialysis clinics throughout the state to cut back services or shut down, making it harder for patients to access their treatments—putting their lives at risk.\n\nDIALYSIS CLINICS ARE STRICTLY REGULATED AND PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY CARE\n\nCalifornia’s dialysis clinics are regulated by federal and state agencies and have high ratings for quality care and patient satisfaction. Each dialysis patient in California is under the care of their own kidney specialist and dialysis treatments are administered by specially trained nurses and licensed technicians. It makes no sense to also require a physician administrator on-site full-time who will not be involved in providing care.\n\nPROP. 29 WOULD WORSEN OUR HEALTH CARE WORKER SHORTAGE AND LEAD TO MORE EMERGENCY ROOM OVERCROWDING\n\n\"Proposition 29 would take thousands of doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners away from hospitals and clinics—where they’re needed—and place them into administrative jobs at dialysis clinics where they aren’t.\"—Marketa Houskova, Doctor of Nursing Practice, RN, Executive Director of American Nurses Association\\California.\n\n\"Prop. 29 would make our growing physician shortage even worse by taking doctors away from hospitals and clinics where they are needed, increasing wait times and reducing capacity to deal with other medical emergencies.\"—Robert E. Wailes, M.D., President, California Medical Association\n\nANOTHER SPECIAL INTEREST ABUSE\n\nThis is the third time this special interest has placed similar dialysis measures on the ballot. Twice, California voters have overwhelmingly rejected these measures. Special interests need to respect the will of the voters and stop threatening dialysis patients’ lives.\n\nJOIN DIALYSIS PATIENTS, FAMILIES, NURSES AND DOCTORS: NO ON 29\n\nProp. 29 opposed by: • Tens of thousands of dialysis patients and families • American Nurses Association\\California • American Academy of Nephrology Physician Assistants • Dialysis Patient Citizens, representing thousands of patients • California Medical Association, representing 40,000 California physicians • Emergency room doctors\n\nwww.NoProp29.com\n\n---Anthony Hicks, Kidney Dialysis Patient; Angelic Nicole Gant, Kidney Dialysis Patient; and Gregory Ridgeway, Kidney Dialysis Patient \n\n\n\nCampaign finance\nSee also: Campaign finance requirements for California ballot measures\nThe campaign finance information on this page reflects the most recently scheduled reports processed by Ballotpedia, which covered through January 31, 2023.\nThe PAC Californians for Kidney Dialysis Patient Protection\twas registered to support the ballot initiative.

If a dialysis center has issues with a patient, staff can contact physicians immediately and they can send a patient to a hospital if needed. Vote NO on Prop 29.\" \nMercury News & East Bay Times Editorial Boards: \"Regulation of the industry is complex and best suited for the Legislature rather than the ballot box. If changes are needed, lawmakers should hear from experts in the field, thoroughly vet any new laws and be open to alterations dictated by sound medical advice. The California Medical Association understands that, which is why it steadfastly opposes Prop. 29. ... Voters have rejected the two previous kidney dialysis ballot measures with good reason. They should do so again by voting no on Prop. 29.\" \nSanta Cruz Sentinel Editorial Board: \"Proposition 29 on the November ballot is an abuse of California’s election system – again. For the third time in five years, leaders of a large labor union are asking voters to approve unnecessary regulations for the kidney dialysis industry that would make it harder for patients to receive critical care. ... Voters have rejected the two previous kidney dialysis ballot measures for good reason. They should do so again and vote no on Prop. 29.\" \nMarin Independent Journal Editorial Board: \"Voters have rejected the two previous kidney dialysis ballot measures with good reason. They should do so again by voting no on Prop. 29.\" \nLos Angeles Times Editorial Board: \"The proponents says the proposition is intended to improve patient care. It’s an assertion they can’t back up with evidence. No other state requires a doctor on-site, nor do the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or the California State Department of Public Health, which regulates dialysis centers. Nor is there evidence that the current arrangement has harmed patients. ... Voters should reject Proposition 29.\" \nSan Francisco Chronicle Editorial Board: \"Nearly 75% of licensed dialysis clinics in California are owned or operated by two for-profit companies: DaVita Inc. and Fresenius Medical Care. Proponents of Prop. 29 don’t hide the fact that they see this measure as part of a strategy to unionize the facilities owned by these companies. ... Voters should reject Prop. 29’s cynical tactics in November — and as many times as they need to in the future.\" \nThe Orange County Register Editorial Board: \"The union thinks that the admittedly small number of firms that run most of the dialysis clinics in this state and throughout the country are too profitable, and this irks them. Again, not a good reason to legally demand artificially high staffing levels just to spite them. That’s why the state’s physicians and other healthcare providers, including the California Medical Association, American Nurses AssociationCalifornia and the American Academy of Nephrology PAs all oppose Prop. 29. ... Vote no on Prop. 29 this November.\" \nThe San Diego Union-Tribune Editorial Board: \"The union thinks if it forces the companies to spend around $100 million every two years to defend the status quo, they will stop opposing unionization. That this tactic could kill people is apparently of no concern. The San Diego Union-Tribune Editorial Board recommends a 'no' vote on Proposition 29.\" \nThe Sacramento Bee Editorial Board: \"Voters resoundingly rejected nearly identical propositions in 2018 and 2020, and they should do the same this year. Proposition 29, the Dialysis Clinic Requirements Initiative, is not a significant improvement on the earlier attempts. Just like the previous measures, it’s a proposed solution in search of a problem.\" \n\n\n\n\nBackground\nCalifornia Proposition 8 (2018)\nSee also: California Proposition 8, Limits on Dialysis Clinics' Revenue and Required Refunds Initiative (2018)\nIn 2018, the campaign Californians for Kidney Dialysis Patient Protection supported a ballot initiative to require dialysis clinics to issue refunds to patients or patients' payers for revenue above 115% of the costs of direct patient care and healthcare improvements.[13] On the ballot as Proposition 8, 59.9% of voters rejected the proposal. On November 7, 2018, Californians for Kidney Dialysis Patient Protection announced that a similar ballot initiative would be filed for 2020.[3]\nThe committees in support or opposition of Proposition 8 had raised a combined $130.43 million, making the ballot measure the most expensive of 2018. The SEIU-UHW West sponsored Californians for Kidney Dialysis Patient Protection, which raised $18.94 million. The California Democratic Party and California Labor Federation supported the campaign. Opponents, organized as Patients and Caregivers to Protect Dialysis Patients, raised $111.48 million, with DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care North America providing 90% of the campaign's funds.[12]\n\n\nCalifornia Proposition 23 (2020)\nSee also: California Proposition 23, Dialysis Clinic Requirements Initiative (2020)\nIn 2020, the SEIU-UHW West launched a new campaign for a ballot initiative to have a minimum of one licensed physician present at the clinic while patients are being treated; report data on dialysis-related infections to the state health department and National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN); and provide a written notice to the state health department and obtain consent from the state health department before closing a chronic dialysis clinic.[2] At the election on November 3, 2020, 63.4% of voters rejected the ballot initiative.[14]\nProposition 23 saw $114.23 million raised between supporters and opponents. The Californians for Kidney Dialysis Patient Protection PAC raised $8.99 million from the SEIU-UHW West. The Stop the Dangerous & Costly Dialysis Proposition PAC was registered to oppose the ballot initiative. The committee had raised $105.24 million, with $66.8 million from DaVita, Inc. and $29.8 million from Fresenius Medical Care.[12]\n\n\nConflict between labor and dialysis businesses\nPropositions 8 and 23 established a new front in the conflict between the SEIU-UHW West, a labor organization, and the state's two largest dialysis businesses DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care.\nThe SEIU-UHW West said workers at dialysis clinics had been attempting to unionize since 2016, but that their employers were retaliating against pro-union employees.[15] Kent Thiry, CEO of DaVita, argued that \"Proposition 8 puts California patients at risk in an effort to force unionization of employees.\"[16][17] Kathy Fairbanks, an opposition spokesperson, similarly stated, \"[Sponsors] want to bring the dialysis community to the table and unionize it. This is just leverage.\"[18] Wherley, a spokesperson for the SEIU-UHW West, contended that dialysis workers \"want these [initiative] reforms regardless of what happens with their union efforts.\"[19] Dave Regan stated, \"The reason Prop. 8 is on the ballot is because they have a terrible business model and they’re gouging patients and insurers.\"[16]\nJim Miller, a columnist for The Sacramento Bee, and Melanie Mason, a state politics journalist for the Los Angeles Times, both stated that the ballot initiative would also provide the SEIU-UHW West with leverage over legislation to enact new regulations on dialysis clinics in the California State Legislature.[19][20] Wherley said the union was taking a two-pronged approach, wanting to make \"sure we have as many options available as possible.\"[19] In 2017, legislation was introduced, but not passed, to require staff-patient ratios in dialysis clinics and, like the ballot initiative, limit the revenue of businesses.[21][22][23][19][24]\n\nWhat is dialysis treatment?\nDialysis is a medical treatment that removes waste products and excess fluids and chemicals from a person's bloodstream. Dialysis is recommended when a person's kidneys lose most of their function. Kidneys filter a person's blood, removing wastes, excess water, and surplus chemicals and nutrients. The substances removed from the bloodstream are deposited in the bladder and discharged as urine.[25][26][27]\nThere are two main types of dialysis treatment—hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\n\nHemodialysis: Before hemodialysis treatments can begin, surgeons create an access point, typically in an arm, to allow technicians to remove blood for treatments. Tubing is attached to allow blood to be pumped between the access point and a hemodialyzer machine, also known as an artificial kidney machine. The machine filters the blood and adds a solution to help remove waste. How often a person needs hemodialysis treatment can vary. According to the National Kidney Foundation, hemodialysis treatments usually occur three times per week and take around four hours each time.[28][29]\nPeritoneal dialysis: Surgeons insert a catheter into the lining of a person's abdomen. The treatment involves pumping a solution into the abdomen. The solution absorbs wastes and uses the lining of the abdomen as a filter. A few hours after the solution has been pumped into the abdomen, the catheter is reopened to allow the solution to drain. Peritoneal dialysis typically occurs three to five times every day, with each treatment taking about 30 to 40 minutes, according to the National Kidney Foundation.[30][31]\nPath to the ballot\nSee also: Laws governing the initiative process in California\nProcess in California\nIn California, the number of signatures required for an initiated state statute is equal to 5 percent of the votes cast in the preceding gubernatorial election. Petitions are allowed to circulate for 180 days from the date the attorney general prepares the petition language. Signatures need to be certified at least 131 days before the general election. As the verification process can take multiple months, the secretary of state provides suggested deadlines for ballot initiatives.\nThe requirements to get initiated state statutes certified for the 2022 ballot:\n\nSignatures: 623,212 valid signatures were required.\nDeadline: The deadline for signature verification was 131 days before the general election, which was around June 30, 2022. However, the process of verifying signatures can take multiple months and proponents are recommended to file signatures at least two months before the verification deadline.\nSignatures are first filed with local election officials, who determine the total number of signatures submitted. If the total number is equal to at least 100 percent of the required signatures, then local election officials perform a random check of signatures submitted in their counties. If the random sample estimates that more than 110 percent of the required number of signatures are valid, the initiative is eligible for the ballot. If the random sample estimates that between 95 and 110 percent of the required number of signatures are valid, a full check of signatures is done to determine the total number of valid signatures. If less than 95 percent are estimated to be valid, the initiative does not make the ballot.\n\nInitiative #20-0013\nSean Fleming and Jonathan Everhart filed the ballot initiative on August 24, 2021. The attorney general of California issued ballot language for the initiative on October 29, 2021, allowing a signature drive to begin. Signatures were due on April 27, 2022. Proponents reported collecting 25% of the required signatures (155,803) on January 24, 2022.[32]\nThe initiative campaign submitted 1,018,730 raw signatures.[33]\nOn June 20, 2022, the secretary of state reported that the random sample concluded that 725,890 signatures were valid.[34]\nSponsors of the measure hired Kimball Petition Management to collect signatures for the petition to qualify this measure for the ballot. A total of $13,374,336.75 was spent to collect the 623,212 valid signatures required to put this measure before voters, resulting in a total cost per required signature (CPRS) of $21.46.\n\n\nHow to cast a vote\nSee also: Voting in California\nClick \"Show\" to learn more about voter registration, identification requirements, and poll times in California.\n\n\n\nHow to cast a vote in California\n\n\n\nPoll times\nAll polls in California are open from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Pacific Time.
