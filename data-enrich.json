Tell us about yourself.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tLoren Taylor is a third-generation Oaklander. He comes from a family with a history of public and community service, and has spent his life committed to serving Oakland. Loren holds a master’s in biomedical engineering from the University of Connecticut and an MBA from UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. \r\nHe spent his early professional career as a biomedical engineer and a management consultant for businesses and nonprofits. After serving as Director in PricewaterhouseCoopers’ Business Strategy & Innovation practice, Loren left corporate America to dedicate himself to empowering underserved people. He launched Custom Taylor Solutions, a social impact consulting firm based in Oakland that works with nonprofits and small businesses to improve the lives of disadvantaged communities. Through service and leadership positions with nonprofits and social justice organizations, Loren has worked for years to alleviate poverty and create economic opportunity in Oakland. \r\nCurrently, Loren proudly serves as the District 6 representative on Oakland’s City Council, where he takes a practical and data-driven approach to solving Oakland’s complex issues. As Councilmember, his decades of experience providing tailored solutions to cities and companies have enabled him to make measurable progress tackling the most difficult challenges. Loren lives in East Oakland with his wife, Dr. Erica Taylor, and their two children, Camryn and Manny.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPlease list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\nAs a third-generation son of Oakland, my dedication to waking up every single morning and working towards a better Oakland is deeply personal. My wife Erica and I have chosen to stay and raise our family here because of everything The Town represents: grit and hard work; diversity and equal opportunity for all; creativity and innovation. We need pragmatic, hands-on leadership to navigate the way forward—someone who focuses on the details of governing instead of the drama and grandstanding that too often holds us back. I’m running for Mayor to be that leader, one who unites our communities to realize Oakland’s potential. As Mayor, I’ll focus on delivering results rather than rhetoric and making progress rather than politics.\nOakland is in my DNA. I’m a proud third-generation Oaklander, born and raised in The Town. This is where I met my wife, started my small business, co-founded a community school and served as PTA president at my son’s public school. My love for Oakland is deep. My commitment to Oakland is personal.   In 2018, I was elected to the City Council, defeating a sixteen-year incumbent. Since then, I have brought my inclusive, pragmatic approach to some of our most difficult challenges. I’ll be a mayor who focuses on what matters to Oaklanders – one who cares about the details of governing instead of the drama and political grandstanding that too often holds us back. I know The Town can do better, and we will. Together.\nMany candidates will tell you they have a progressive vision of a better future for Oakland, but Oaklanders deserve a mayor who will roll up their sleeves and do the hard work necessary to make that vision a reality. Innovative, progressive, and pragmatic: that’s the mindset that will solve Oakland’s most pressing problems. That’s what I’ve proven I can do in my career and as a Councilmember, and that’s what I’ll do as Mayor. Together, we can make Oakland safer and a place where we all can live, learn, work, and play. Together, we can ensure that every Oaklander has access to housing they can afford, quality public education, and the opportunity to thrive. If you join me, together we will build a new future for ourselves and the city we lov\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhat areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\t1. Making Oakland Neighborhoods Safer: Oaklanders deserve a place where they can all live, work and play.  I won’t tolerate more violence and crime; I will champion smart investments in violence prevention and partner with responsible law enforcement to keep Oakland safe. My public safety plan strikes the right balance between compassion and enforcement and between preventing crime and responding to it. I will deliver the “both-and” solution instead of an “either-or” excuse, and take an active role in everything from revisiting Oakland’s internal policies, recruitment, and hiring practices to exploring big systemic changes.\n\r\n2. Tackling Homelessness and Making Housing Affordable for All: Oakland’s next mayor needs to face our homelessness and housing crises head-on. I will close unsafe homeless encampments and move our unhoused neighbors into the shelters and treatment programs they need. As your next Mayor, just as I have done as a Councilmember, I will support building thousands of both affordable and market-rate units, so families can stay and thrive here in Oakland.\n\r\n3. Restoring Our Clean Streets: Our dirty streets are unacceptable. I will stop illegal dumping to make sure that Oaklanders can enjoy our public spaces and small businesses and commercial districts can thrive.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Ballotpedia reserves the right to edit Candidate Connection survey responses.

            "wiki_text": "Sheng Thao (born 1985) is an American politician and the 51st and current mayor of Oakland, California. She is the first Hmong American mayor of a major city in the United States.\n\nEarly life and education\nThao was born and raised in Stockton, California. Her parents were refugees from Laos who escaped Hmong genocide and eventually immigrated to the United States. Thao was the seventh of ten children and grew up in poverty, spending some of her childhood in public housing.At age 17, Thao moved out of her home and began working at a Walgreens in Richmond. After moving to Oakland in her 20s, she became a victim of domestic violence while in an abusive relationship. Thao left the relationship when she was six months pregnant, and then lived in her car and couch surfed before and after her son was born. When her son was ten months old, Thao began attending Merritt College in Oakland while raising her son as a single mother and working as a research assistant.After she completed an associate's degree in legal studies from Merritt, Thao transferred to the University of California, Berkeley, where she earned a bachelor's degree in legal studies and a minor in city planning. While at UC Berkeley, Thao helped create the Bear Pantry, a program which provided food to food-insecure students.\n\nEarly career\nFollowing her graduation from UC Berkeley in 2012, Thao worked for At-Large Councilmember Rebecca Kaplan as a paid intern. Thao later worked for Kaplan at the Oakland City Council and  became her chief of staff in 2017.\n\nOakland City Council\nThao served in the Oakland City Council's 4th district seat, representing the neighborhoods of Montclair, Laurel, Melrose, Redwood Heights, and the Dimond District. She was the first Hmong woman to be elected as a member of the city council in the state of California and the first Hmong person elected to the Oakland City Council. On the city council, Thao served as president pro tempore.Thao decided to run for office in 2018, when the election for the district 4 City Council seat was an open race, lacking an incumbent. Thao defeated six other candidates and won with 54% of the vote after seven rounds of instant-runoff voting tabulation. For each of the 7 rounds she had the most votes of any candidate. Thao's priorities which she ran on were tackling Oakland's housing crisis, improving public safety with better response systems and community policing, and building public infrastructure such as libraries and parks. One of Thao's opponents Charlie Michelson, had been endorsed by Mayor Libby Schaaf. During her campaign, Thao and fellow candidates Pamela Harris and Nayeli Maxson co-endorsed each other in the ranked-choice voting. Dubbing themselves the \"Women's Leadership Slate\", they urged voters to rank the three of them as their first three picks.After Kamala Harris was elected vice president of the United States, Thao and other elected officials lobbied Governor Gavin Newsom to appoint Barbara Lee to the U.S. Senate seat that Harris would vacate. Alex Padilla was ultimately appointed to the seat.\n\nMayoral campaign\nOn November 10, 2021, Thao announced her candidacy for the 2022 Oakland mayoral election.During her campaign, Thao was supported by many trade unions, and she was endorsed by the local Democratic Party and Rep. Ro Khanna. Loren Taylor, one of her opponents, was endorsed by Libby Schaaf, the incumbent mayor of Oakland, as well as London Breed and Sam Liccardo, the mayors of nearby San Francisco and San Jose. By the end of the campaign, Thao and Taylor were considered to be the two front-runners. Thao was viewed as a progressive candidate, while opponents Taylor and Ignacio De La Fuente were viewed as more centrist.In June 2022, a former staffer filed an informal verbal complaint with the Public Ethics Commission that alleged Thao had City Council staff work on her campaign in a possible violation of state election laws, and the staffer was fired after refusing to work on Thao's campaign. Thao denied the allegations and the ethics commission opened an investigation in June 2022. After the matter was reported by a political blogger that supported one of Thao's competitors in October 2022, the allegations gained media attention.Thao won the ranked-choice election by 677 votes in the final round of tabulation.\n\nMayoralty\nThao took office on January 9, 2023.Days into her mayoralty, Thao placed Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong on administrative leave over allegations that he had obstructed an investigation into a hit and run incident that involved a police officer. After a probe was conducted, Thao fired Armstrong on February 15, 2023.In April 2023, Thao announced that city would end long-standing negotiations with the owners of the Oakland Athletics for a waterfront ballpark making it likely that the MLB team will relocate to Las Vegas, Nevada after reaching an agreement to build a $1.5 billion new ballpark on the Las Vegas Strip. Thao later met with Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred during the 2023 MLB All-Star Game in which she outlined the city's plans for a new ballpark at the Coliseum or Howard Terminal from years prior through a document sent to him and 29 other MLB owners in a bid to keep the Athletics from relocating to Las Vegas three months after the Athletics' ballpark received public financing from the state of Nevada in a special session and the team beginning the relocation process to Las Vegas.\n\nPersonal life\nThao has lived in Oakland during her entire adulthood. She lives with her partner, Andre, and their two children. When she served on the Oakland City Council, she was one of three council members who rented their home. She is the first renter to be elected as Oakland's mayor.\n\nReferences\nExternal links\nProfile at Vote Smart\n Media related to Sheng Thao at Wikimedia Commons",

She’s known for her inspiring life story of perseverance and unwavering commitment to standing up for those without a voice. Now, Sheng Thao is ready to lead our city as mayor—because Oakland’s time is now. LEFT Sheng at six months with six of her siblings. Her parents were Hmong refugees who fled genocide in Laos. RIGHT Sheng at two years old with her sister in Stockton. A Daughter of Refugees, Sheng’s Commitment to Justice and Drive to Make a Difference are Rooted in Where She Comes From Sheng grew up in poverty, the 7th of 10 kids. Her parents met in a refugee camp in Thailand after each fled their home country of Laos and the genocide against the Hmong people. Sheng’s mom, widowed and eight months pregnant, had been shot in the arm during her escape. Sheng’s dad had helped many other refugees flee across the Mekong River during his journey. Sheng’s parents immigrated to America, settling in Stockton, where they would make a living farming vegetables. It was here Sheng was born. LEFT Sheng with her son, Ben at her graduation from Merritt College. RIGHT Sheng with Ben, now 15, on a recent hike. A Single Mom Who Survived Domestic Violence, Persistence Drove Sheng Thao to Make it, and Then to Make a Difference for Others As a kid, Sheng’s family was always on social services. For a time, they lived in public housing. Sheng grew up with the very real fear of not having a stable home, so she understands what so many families worry about every day. Sheng got her first job at 16, and left home at 17. In her early 20s, she found herself in an abusive relationship, isolated from family—and pregnant. Sheng was able to escape this domestic violence, but soon had a baby and nowhere to go. For months, Sheng and her son, Ben slept on strangers’ couches, and sometimes in her car. When Ben was 10 months old, Sheng got a job at Merritt College, and also started taking classes. And, with the help of welfare, and a Head Start program for Ben, she put herself through school. She became class Valedictorian, then transferred to UC Berkeley, where she co-founded a food access program for low-income students and graduated with a degree in legal studies. A Barrier-Breaking Councilmember and One of Oakland’s Most Creative, Substantive, and Effective Leaders on Housing, Homelessness, and Public Safety Finding her calling in public service, Sheng joined the office of Oakland’s Councilmember At-Large, which represents the entire city, and worked her way up to Chief of Staff. In that role, Sheng helped manage multiple City budgets, fought for affordable housing, helped small businesses open, worked to get guns off our streets, and fought for cleaner air and water. Sheng knew she could do even more as an elected official herself. So she ran for City Council District 4 and won, becoming the first Hmong-American woman Councilmember in California history. As a Councilmember, Sheng helped bring the Council together, change the tone at City Hall, finally break through years of gridlock, and make progress on critical issues. At City Hall, Sheng has passed over 100 laws. Sheng brought the Council together to fund both violence prevention and new police academies. She helped make historic investments in violence prevention programs, and brought the MACRO program here, providing alternatives to an armed police response for those in mental health crisis. Sheng helped restore the City’s anti-gang violence Ceasefire program. She also brokered a landmark public safety agreement, breaking a Council deadlock, to fund three new police academies, while also holding OPD accountable for overtime costs and pushing to diversify the police force by hiring more women of color and Oakland residents. Sheng united labor and business to secure millions in funding for housing and homelessness services. She brought the two sides together when nobody else could, securing a historic agreement to raise taxes on big corporations, reduce taxes on small businesses, and generate $22 million a year to fund public safety, affordable housing, homeless prevention, parks, libraries, and street paving. Sheng has been a dedicated and effective champion for those who have been left out and left behind. She has secured millions in funding for affordable housing, homeless services, and marginalized youth. Sheng helped save our Head Start program, protecting free early childhood education and family services for low-income Oaklanders. She fought back against school closures in Black and Latino neighborhoods. During the Trump years, Sheng stood up to ICE to protect our immigrant communities. A champion for workers' rights, Sheng expanded the City’s paid sick leave policy, and passed legislation to ensure thousands of laid off workers could get their jobs back when the state reopened during COVID. In response to COVID, Sheng stood up to protect renters, supporting Oakland’s eviction moratorium, the strongest in the Bay Area. She also co-founded the Oakland Mutual Aid Collective, which distributed 100,000 pieces of personal protective equipment (PPE). Sheng led the way in making Oakland the first sanctuary city for abortion rights in California. After the Roe v. Wade decision was leaked, Sheng took action, ensuring that no matter who is President or Governor, Oakland’s family planning clinics will remain open and our people will be free from harassment by anti-choice extremists. Sheng is City Hall’s leader on wildfire prevention and emergency preparedness. She’s led on the undergrounding of utilities in high-risk areas, expanded our budget for clearing highly flammable vegetation, and she’s working to establish a regional wildfire prevention strategy with other local governments. A noted budget expert, Sheng’s colleagues often turn to her for fiscal guidance. She’s helped double the budget for street paving, led major investments in parks across the city, and authored a budget deal which solved a decades-old dispute and to saved Chabot Space and Science Center, protecting vital STEM programs for Oakland youth. Click here for a more detailed list of Sheng's accomplishments. In each role she takes on, Sheng’s colleagues elevate her into leadership positions. She’s currently Council President Pro Tem and chairs the Rules and Legislation Committee. Sheng received the 2021 Powerful Women of the Bay Award for her work on behalf of Oakland’s diverse neighborhoods, and has been honored by the Alameda Labor Council for her record of delivering for working families. Sheng is also the past President of the League of California Cities API Caucus, and has served on boards for the Redwood Heights Association and Oakland Asian Cultural Center. Sheng lives near Joaquin Miller Park with her partner, Andre, their 15-year old son, Ben and 8-year old daughter, Brooklyn. Sheng is one of only three renters on the Oakland City Council. “ As Mayor of Oakland, I will bring that same determination and relentlessness that has defined my entire life, to move our city forward.

            "wiki_text": "Ignacio De La Fuente (born January 1, 1949) is a former Oakland City Councilmember.  He was also the President of Oakland's City Council until January 2009, when he became vice mayor of Oakland. De La Fuente was an unsuccessful candidate for mayor of Oakland in 1998, 2006, and 2022.\n\nBackground\nDe La Fuente was born in Mexico City, immigrated to California at the age of 21, and subsequently became an American citizen. De La Fuente settled in Oakland, California and began working in a foundry as a machinist.\n\nTrade union representative\nIn 1977 he was elected as a union representative of Phoenix Iron Works.  Today De La Fuente serves as an International Vice President for the Glass, Molders, Pottery, Plastics, and Allied Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, where he negotiates for members through the collective bargaining process.\n\nOakland City Council\nFirst elected to the Oakland City Council in 1992, he served as the chair of the council's Economic and Community Development Committee until January 1999.  When Oakland adopted the Strong-Mayor form of government, that removed the Mayor from the City Council and created the position of Council President. De La Fuente became the first Council member to be elected by his peers to serve as President of the Oakland City Council in 1999. He has been re-elected to this position every two years since then.\n\nOpposition to medical marijuana movement\nIn 1998, when the Oakland City Council deputized the Oakland Cannabis Buyer's Cooperative to distribute medical marijuana, De La Fuente cast a negative vote, saying that he could not support such efforts in \"good conscience,\" citing concerns over abuse as well as control, certification, and monitoring of caregivers. De La Fuente supported efforts in 2003 to shutter all of Oakland's dispensaries but one, contending that \"at least half of the clubs (were) selling pot for recreational use.\"\n\n2006 mayoral campaign\nDe La Fuente ran unsuccessfully for Mayor of Oakland in 2006, placing second of three major candidates, behind the winner (former Congressman Ron Dellums) but ahead of challenger Nancy Nadel. On June 16, 2006, after a careful ballot recount, and a dispute over whether votes for unqualified write-in candidates such as George W. Bush and Homer Simpson counted towards the total, Dellums was declared the winner in the Oakland mayoral race. Dellums garnered the 50.18 percent majority he needed to win the election  This was 155 votes more than needed to avoid a runoff. Dellums received 41,992 votes, while De La Fuente received 27,607 votes, and Nadel 10,928 votes.\n\n2012 at-large city council campaign\nIn 2012 De La Fuente challenged Rebecca Kaplan for the at-large set on the Oakland City Council, leaving open the district 5 seat. De La Fuente lost to Kaplan, while Noel Gallo won the district 5 race to succeed De La Fuente. De La Fuente made false statements during his campaign.\n\n2022 Oakland mayoral campaign\nDe La Fuente ran for Mayor of Oakland in the 2022 Oakland mayoral election. He ran on a \"back to basics\" slogan. His campaign has received most of its funding from coal lobbyists. Other candidates have signed a pledge not to take lobbying money from the coal industry. De La Fuente lost; only receiving about 10% of the vote.\n\nOakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority\nIn January 2017 De La Fuente was appointed to the Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Authority board.\n\nPersonal life\nDe La Fuente lives in Oakland.\nOn October 26, 2007, the councilman's son, Ignacio De La Fuente Jr., was sentenced to fourteen years in prison for the rape of three women, and a 15-year-old girl. The councilman maintains his son's innocence, and claims there was a \"conspiracy\" within the Oakland Police Department to target his son, and publicize the charges, for the purpose of embarrassing the elder De La Fuente during his unsuccessful 2006 mayoral bid. His son pleaded guilty and admitted to the sexual assaults.On December 23, 2010, De La Fuente was arrested for speeding and DUI. A California Highway Patrol officer alleged to have observed De La Fuente speeding around 80 miles per hour (130 km/h) and making unsafe lane changes while driving his 2006 Buick on the Nimitz Freeway, I-880, near the Fruitvale Avenue exit in East Oakland. A CHP spokesperson alleges that, after being stopped, De La Fuente was noticeably impaired and failed field sobriety and driver coordination tests.  He was booked into the North County jail in Downtown Oakland before being released the same evening to the custody of his wife, Elvia. De La Fuente failed a sobriety test and driver coordination tests. Prosecutors, citing a lack of evidence, mainly lack of a blood test to prove his blood alcohol level, declined to seek DUI charges against De La Fuente.\n\n\n== References ==",

We amplify community voices, share the power of real information, and investigate systems, not just symptoms. Donate We invited nine of the 10 people running to be the next mayor of Oakland to sit down with us for in-depth interviews, asking them mostly the same questions. Such as, how many police officers does the Oakland Police Department need? How would they help the City Council and the city administration work together better? How would they fix Oakland’s potholes? We developed these questions with help from hundreds of Oakland residents who answered our election survey this summer; thank you to everyone who weighed in. Oakland mayoral candidate interviews Greg Hodge Seneca Scott Loren Taylor Ignacio De La Fuente Sheng Thao Treva Reid Allyssa Victory John Reimann Tyron Jordan Settle in for a long read; these conversations are weighty, befitting the office these candidates seek. They’ve been edited for length, relevance, and clarity, with some added fact-checking and background reading from us. We’re publishing them over the next week or so; note that we decided not to interview candidate Peter Liu and provide another platform for his dangerous and hateful rhetoric. ) This interview is with Ignacio De La Fuente, who served District 5 on the Oakland City Council from 1992 until 2011, including roughly a decade as council president. De La Fuente, an Oakland resident for more than five decades, has said he chose to come out of political retirement because he believes the city has become a worse place for people to live due to a lack of political will to enforce city laws. De La Fuente has espoused a “back to basics” approach to local governance that would prioritize public safety. Over the years, we’ve seen several examples of tension between the City Council and the city administration. As mayor, you’d be the city administrator’s boss. How would you help the council and the city administration work together better? The same way I did when I was on the City Council for 21 years. I proved my ability to work with the majority of the council and was elected by my peers as council president. Why? Because I managed to build relationships with respect and with the corporation of the majority of the City Council, and with the administration. I believe that the mayor has, as the highest elected official in the city, the responsibility to make sure the administration and the elected policymakers work together to accomplish their goals, represent citizens, and get this city moving in the right direction. Regarding the last budget that the mayor drafted and the City Council approved, with amendments: Was there anything in that budget that you strongly disagreed with and would have excluded if you were mayor? And is there anything that you feel was left out of that budget? The allocation of resources for public safety [was missing]. What are the priorities for this city? To me, public safety and homelessness are the priority. I probably would’ve allocated more resources to law enforcement and for homeless camp cleanups. Oakland is thousands of units short of meeting its affordable housing construction goals set by the region and the state. Would expanding affordable housing in Oakland be a priority of yours as mayor? Can you share some of the concrete steps you would take to do that? How would market-rate development and social housing play a role in your plan? First, I have to say that Oakland has actually provided more affordable housing units than the entire county. [ Editor’s note: According to the Association of Bay Area Governments , from 2015 to 2020 Oakland build 29% of all affordable housing in the county. ] I believe it’s the responsibility not only of Oakland to provide affordable housing, but the rest of the county. So as mayor of Alameda County’s largest city, I will push the county and push other cities to do their share. I don’t think that Oakland can do it all. Number two, Oakland doesn’t have what it used to have decades ago, which was housing funds. We have no specific resources or money for housing. So you have to use market-rate housing and market-rate developments to generate revenue and to build affordable housing units. [ Editor’s note: Oakland has dedicated funds for affordable housing through its impact fees, Measure KK, and state and federal grants, however, the city no longer can use redevelopment , a state program that existed when De La Fuente was on the council which allowed Oakland to use future growth in property tax revenue to pay for large scale projects, including affordable housing. ] Are you referring to impact fees? Or can you describe how the market-rate developments would fund affordable housing? Through negotiations with developers—because I believe we already have impact fees—so I think it’s more the ability of the city to facilitate and to make sure the development works, and at the same time that we use that leverage to get developers to do more, especially for affordable housing units. And again, I believe that Oakland should not be the only city that is required to fulfill our responsibilities of building affordable housing. What policies and programs would you pursue as mayor to get the 5,000 unhoused people off the street in Oakland? And how would you balance some of these pressing safety concerns, like fires associated with homeless encampments, with pleas from the community to not criminalize people trying to survive out there? You used the word “balance.” I believe that’s what we need to do—balance the needs of the homeless population with the needs of our residents and our businesses. I believe we have the moral responsibility to help as many people as we can, especially when it comes to homelessness. But not at the expense of businesses or the expense of residents and other people who cannot enjoy this city and take their children to school. I was in a Zoom meeting a couple of months ago with 200 people in East Oakland, and the cries for help when it comes to homeless encampments in their neighborhood are real. So balancing and ensuring that we enforce the laws we have [is important]. We cannot allow Oakland to be the only city in the county that’s assimilating thousands of homeless individuals. Prioritizing and balancing is the question. [ Editor’s note: Oakland bears a disproportionate burden of the homelessness crisis; the city has one-quarter of the county’s total population but half the county’s homeless people are Oakland residents. Both the county and Oakland saw similar increases of between 22% and 24% in homelessness from 2019 to 2022. ] I believe in a multi-agency approach. The reality is that homelessness and mental health is the responsibility of the county and the state, not the city of Oakland. So as the mayor of the largest city, I will push the county to do its job, do a better job, of cooperating with the city—a multi-agency approach with results—not just pouring money into the system. We just read from the auditor that last year the city spent $69 million on homeless services and we have nothing to show for it. So concrete, results-based approaches, I believe, are necessary to prevent what’s happening. Can you name one or two specific policies or programs on the books that you would pursue enforcement of or introduce to right that balance? Again, I think that the city has not pushed the county to do its job, to be candid. Again, it’s the county’s responsibility. When it comes to a specific approach, I’ve been talking to some members of the board of supervisors. We cannot do everything at the same time, but targeting two or three of the major encampments in the city of Oakland—set up a timeline, 120 or 180 days, to work with these specific encampments. The [ Encampment Management Policy ] allocates resources and relocation places. That’s what we need to do. The city already purchased many hotels downtown and many rooms for single occupancy. All of that, I believe, requires real commitment and enforcement. Sometimes, people that are living on the streets do not want to follow any rules or want to do anything—they want to stay where they are. And I think it’s our job to make sure that at the same time that we offer services and work with them, at the end of the day, we have to enforce the rules in order for us to really start cleaning up the city. And I believe homeless encampments have created a very difficult challenge for businesses and residents. I think at some point we have to enforce the rules and make sure that people follow them. One of the biggest challenges that business owners say they’re dealing with right now is the rising cost of goods due to global supply chain issues. Have you thought about any local solutions to remedying this national problem? Honestly, I don’t know if any city can remedy this national problem, but I believe that cities are responsible for responding to some of the crises we face. And I believe that in Oakland if you ask businesses, which I do all the time—because I’m out all the time—public safety is one of the biggest challenges right now. I know that the high cost of goods is a challenge, but what’s even more challenging for them is the safety of their businesses and the constant break-ins and robberies. So first, I will make sure that the businesses not only feel safe but that we provide that vital service, as local government. I think Oakland has a reputation that it takes too long to get [building and business] permits, and it takes too long to get anything done in the city. So streamlining the process and being facilitators versus obstructionist is the answer. In our reader surveys, residents have noted the lack of large grocery stores with fresh produce in West and East Oakland. How will you work with the councilmembers in those areas to create more grocery stores with better, healthier options? Very good question. I think that we have managed to increase the number. I think that when Jerry Brown was the mayor and came out with the idea of attracting 10,000 new residents to downtown Oakland, that actually became a reality. [ Editor’s note: Brown’s “10K plan” came up short during his tenure, but under later mayors Jean Quan and Libby Schaaf, building picked up downtown leading to the addition of thousands of new apartments. ] That means the demand for grocery stores, especially in neighborhoods like West Oakland or East Oakland, is real. I think the challenge for Oakland right now and the main reason that I’m running for mayor is the public safety issue. Businesses are leaving, they are not coming to Oakland. And they’re leaving because they know that the city is not doing a good enough job at protecting them. Creating a safe environment and attracting businesses is absolutely vital. We cannot do what this council is doing. The progressive tax on the November ballot, in my opinion, will kill jobs. When we are the highest-taxed city in the Bay Area, it’s more difficult to retain and attract businesses. So I’m opposing the tax. I actually signed the argument against the progressive tax on the ballot because I believe it will be bad for Oakland. So creating a level playing field, creating a city that is facilitating instead of obstructionist, and that is providing a safe environment, to me is the key for us to help small businesses in the city of Oakland. Regarding economic development, a political action committee has been set up by a local developer and a hedge-fund manager from Los Angeles . They want to build a coal export terminal on the waterfront near the Port of Oakland. They have put $100,000 into this committee. It’s an independent expenditure committee—so we understand that it’s not coordinating with your campaign—but it is supporting you for mayor. What is your position on the coal export terminal? I don’t know if you checked or not, but actually, we voted on that terminal. I was still on the City Council back in 2010, I believe it was when we actually approved that terminal. So I voted for it. I am a very pro-development person. I believe that we have to increase our tax base, versus raising taxes. If you check my record of 20 years on the City Council, I was always a very pro-development person. And not just the Army base—we’re talking about almost every project in Oakland—because I believe increasing our tax base and generating jobs is necessary. So I do support our ability to use our resources like the Port of Oakland to attract businesses. I also believe there is enough technology available to deal with any [pollution] those businesses create. So to answer your question, I supported it before and believe in development. In my opinion, there’s no city that can survive without retaining and increasing its tax base and promoting businesses. So I do. The city’s argument, when it tried to stop that project, was that the environmental impacts would be severe . That the terminal would blow coal dust into East and West Oakland, worsening asthma for the communities that already experience a disproportionate pollution level. Do you feel that’s not a concern? The city came out with that [argument] after they approved the project, right? So why did they approve it? Why did these people vote for it, if that was the case? You know, it’s very easy to be a Monday-morning quarterback. California is one of the toughest states in the country when it comes to environmental protection. We have so many agencies that it’s very difficult for businesses to even function. I believe that those state agencies are responsible for establishing standards and ensuring that people live by the standards created for different industries. If we don’t, then it’s our fault and it’s the agencies’ fault. But I do believe that the people who are now opposing [the coal terminal] are the same people that voted for it. They would have said that they weren’t aware at the time that coal was going to be shipped through there. But that is definitely a controversy. And the developer says that that was disclosed at the time, and that’s been litigated. I’m correct, and I can tell you that everybody knew. Now, did things get hot afterward, and did people change their minds and get wishy-washy? Yes. Again, I’m one of those people that built a reputation of, what you see is what you get. Do I make all the right decisions all the time? No. But do I live by them? Absolutely. Ignacio De La Fuente speaking at a mayoral candidates forum in August. The Coliseum and the Arena are huge entertainment hubs for the city. If the Oakland Athletics move to Howard Terminal, or if they leave the city entirely, that’ll leave those facilities without sports tenants to anchor them. What would be your plans for those properties? Thank you for that question. You know, I was on the Alameda Coliseum Joint Powers Authority Commission for 20 or 30 years. It’s about 150 or 160 acres of land owned by the city and the county. Unfortunately, the county made the dumb decision to sell their half to the A’s—and they haven’t even paid for it yet. But I believe that that site has got to be developed—the whole site, not no half the site, obviously. So as mayor, I will try to reconsolidate those 150 acres. I believe that it’s the best piece of land in the entire country. I’m not just talking about California. You have every mode of transportation there. You have an airport within five minutes. It’s the best possible site for major development. Oakland has no retail. Oakland has no bowling alley. Oakland lacks many, many things that can be in that particular location. I can guarantee you that that is one of the most attractive sites, anywhere. As mayor, I will use the office to attract development and negotiate the best possible development on that site, create jobs and a tax base, and retain the buying power of our residents. The fact is that Oaklanders spend all their money in Emeryville or in San Francisco or Walnut Creek, but not in Oakland. Why? We not only have no grocery stores but no major retail. Why is that? Because of all the issues that we face, and there’s no leadership. You need a salesperson. You need someone that has the willingness to spend the time going and knocking on doors and bringing businesses here. And that’s what I will do as mayor of this city. Oakland currently spends several million dollars a year from its budget on the arts, supporting arts organizations and institutions. Is that something you support? Do you think the city should be spending money directly on the arts? Absolutely. Art and culture are ingrained in who we are. And in my opinion, art and our diversity of culture in Oakland help minimize our challenges. Not only will I continue supporting the arts, but I will also attract more private investment and more champions for the arts. So the answer is yes, absolutely. While public schools in Oakland are run by OUSD and charter school organizations, Mayor Libby Schaaf has made education a big part of her tenure, through her support of programs like Oakland Undivided and Oakland Promise. What role should the mayor have in Oakland’s public education? I wish that the school district was in the mayor’s office, but it’s not. Obviously, we know that OUSD has its own board, its own elected officials, budgets, and everything else. But I think the mayor, as the highest elected office in the city, has the responsibility to promote, to do whatever they can, to help our residents get the best education possible. I think some of the programs that Libby and the city are working on are absolutely wonderful and I will continue supporting that. But we also know that Oakland and OUSD have a relationship. We share soccer fields and facilities, and there are many other parts of education where the city shares responsibilities with OUSD. I will continue supporting that. When I got elected to City Council back in 1992, I was a little bit naive as a councilmember, and I thought I would have more of a say about education in my district. Unfortunately, I found out real quick that it was not that simple. So I shifted my goal to build a couple of new schools in District 5—Ascend and Cesar Chavez Learning Center—to ensure that children in the district I represented would have schools as good as those they have up in the hills and in some other places. So I will continue doing that, with the understanding that obviously I’m running for office because I believe that public safety and the cleanliness of the city are my priorities, and everything else will come after that. But parents will be able to walk their children to school without being afraid of going through encampments and other aspects of public safety they’re concerned with. We know that many of Oakland’s streets are poorly maintained. They have potholes. Some are poorly designed. On others, there are not enough lights. How would you improve road conditions and traffic safety in Oakland? Back to the basics. We forgot what the basic responsibilities of local government are: police, fire, streets, and infrastructure, which is a hundred years old in Oakland. You’ve got to allocate resources and you have to make sure that we actually do the job. That’s what we are required to do. And it’s not only the potholes. One of the challenges we see every single day is that people don’t respect the traffic laws, period. Especially not in Oakland, where a red light doesn’t mean anything anymore. We are not enforcing any rules on the roads, which is why it’s getting worse and worse and worse. [ Editor’s note: Oakland is a large city with many miles of road and lots of dangerous traffic violations, but there are relatively few officers on patrol at any given time, until recently there was no dedicated traffic squad, and most officers spend most of their time addressing non-traffic related calls for service. Over the past few years, OPD has issued between 2,000 and 3,000 traffic tickets per year . It’s unclear how many red light, speeding, and reckless driving violations there are in a total year, but it’s certainly many more than a few thousand. ] It’s the same thing with homelessness. You know, we used to have, I think, 1,500 homeless 10 years ago. Now we’re talking about 5,000 . For the same reasons. If we do not enforce the laws on the streets and on roads, people get used to doing whatever they want to do. That’s exactly what’s happening in Oakland. These things have become normal. Not only car break-ins but the ability of people to run red lights and not abide by traffic laws is one of our biggest challenges. That’s why we have people run over by cars, especially on our main roads, International Boulevard, and Foothill. Back when I was on the City Council, we were actually more aggressive when it came to enforcing the rules on the roads. Nowadays, Oakland is not enforcing anything. That’s one of the challenges, one of the realities that many people don’t even want to recognize—that we are not enforcing the laws, period. Could you be more specific about your philosophy around traffic enforcement? Do you think that we need more or fewer cops? Do we need a deputized citizenry? Do we need more technology? Do we need more cops? Absolutely. And we need technology. I’m the biggest promoter of giving police the tools and the technology that is available in order to do their job. License plate readers, cameras, you name it. We absolutely need more police officers. We used to have a traffic unit. We don’t have it anymore. [ Editor’s note: OPD Chief LeRonne Armstrong announced the reinstatement of the traffic unit on Sept. 27. ] I think that’s one of the reasons why we have the escalation that we have. So hire more police officers, reinstate a traffic unit that will be accountable, file reports, enforce the law, and show people that we are actually enforcing the law and change people’s attitudes. Otherwise, it won’t happen. I mention enforcement because I believe that’s the biggest problem that we have in Oakland—that everything has become normal. People don’t want to recognize it. That’s fine. I know because I talk to people, and I know how they feel about it. Outside of enforcement, Oakland has spent a lot of money in recent years on new infrastructure. And people in Oakland have strong opinions about what’s more important: building new infrastructure for biking and walking or improving roads for driving. Where do you fall? You know, when you look at Telegraph Avenue, when you look at Foothill Boulevard, we can try to emulate some of the cities that are different than we are, and build bike lanes on every road and have a bunch of [rental] bikes on the sides of the roads in areas of Oakland that nobody uses. So, no, I’m for improving the roads and improving the flow of traffic. Since public safety is the main issue you’re running on, we want to drill down into the details a little bit more. Oakland has 681 police officers right now. Is that too few or too many? And can you explain your thinking on the issue of police staffing? Oakland needs a minimum of 750 to 800. So my first priority, to set the tone, would be that we are going to hire more police officers. But to me, it’s even more important to give them the political support for them to do the job, so we can attract officers. You know, it takes a year and a half from recruiting to actually putting a cop on the street, and it costs a couple-hundred-thousand dollars a piece. We need lateral transfers and we need to reinstate the tone in Oakland that instead of attacking the police, we’re going to support them to do their jobs right. And to me right now the biggest challenge is, officers are demoralized. There is no support for them to do the job. So I will give police officers the tools available for law enforcement so they can do their job, maximize the resources, and provide political support publicly as mayor, for them to do their job of protecting the citizens and protecting businesses. In 2010, when the city’s budget was heavily impacted by the Great Recession, you were part of the group of councilmembers who negotiated with the Oakland Police Officer’s Association, and you were a proponent of laying off about 150 police officers . If the city hit a hard budget patch again and you were mayor, what would you say to voters who might think that you would lay police officers off again? Well, first, that’s not correct. I never proposed to lay off 150 officers. Secondly, I think that it was Mayor Ron Dellums, Councilmember Jane Brunner, and myself who sat down for days and negotiated a new contract with OPOA. Police officers were the only group in Oakland that did not pay the 13% contribution to the pension. At that time, with the budget crunch, when every other union and department was contributing to the pension and taking pay cuts, it was essential that everybody share the pain. So we sat down to negotiate a contract with OPOA. They were going to pay the 13%, and in the end, they changed their mind and we had to lay off some police officers to balance the equation . Did I want to do that? No. They made that call when they didn’t want to pay the 13%. So will I be a tough negotiator with them and every other union? Yes. Should everybody share the pain when times are hard? Absolutely. So I think it’s again a question of how willing we are—that during good times, people get a good increase in pay, and when it’s tough times, all of us have to bite the bullet and share the pain. You mentioned giving officers the tools they need to address crime, including license plate readers, which have been a divisive issue in the city. You’ve also supported youth curfews and gang injunctions in years past. Has your thinking changed about those approaches or do you still think they are viable public safety policies? To me, the situation at the time demands whatever policy or action you might take. You are absolutely correct. I supported gang injunctions back in the day. Why? Because the gangs were expanding so rapidly and the shooters were getting more brash and people were caught on the sidelines and people were caught in the middle of those shootings. So sometimes you have to do whatever you need to do for your job, to protect your citizens, to make sure that people are safe. Sometimes you have to use tools that are maybe not acceptable to some. I believe every tool should be available to local government in a time of crisis, absolutely. And I believe we are in a time of crisis now. That’s why I’m running. When it comes to gun violence, what would you do as mayor to help prevent it? Are there programs currently operating like Ceasefire, the Department of Violence Prevention, that you would support or expand? Anything you would eliminate or do differently? Again, sometimes emergencies and crises demand different responses. I support Ceasefire , I support some of these programs that are absolutely working. ShotSpotter was one of the things that we used to try, to give police the tools they need. So I will support that. There are cities that are doing things dramatically different when it comes to policing. I think technology, and some of the things that you mentioned—license-plate readers and cameras and the ability to see who’s coming into your city, all those things—some people oppose them, but I believe they’re necessary sometimes. And that’s one of the reasons why I believe I’m the best person for the job at this time. I will take whatever actions are necessary to fulfill local government’s biggest responsibility, which is to protect our businesses and people. You were on the City Council from 1992 to 2011. During that timeframe, Oakland saw its highest and second-highest periods of gun violence . You’re running as a law and order candidate who will reduce crime. Why should voters expect you to be the person who can come in and solve this problem? Well, to be fair, you’ve got to go back 20, 30, 40, or 50 years, right? I mean, this is Oakland. Crime spikes in Oakland have been going up, down, and sideways for many, many years. I was there, as you remember, I was there as a City Council member. Being a mayor is totally different. As a councilmember, you are one of eight. You need consensus. You need to have the majority, which often requires you to compromise on issues and policies and tools. As mayor, you are the highest-ranking elected official, you are the administrator’s [boss]. You have the ability to direct the bureaucracy to actually manage your resources and manage the agencies that are under the mayor. So it’s a little different, it’s apples and oranges, the way I see it. Totally different, but obviously, I hear what you’re saying. Mayor Libby Schaaf has raised vast amounts of money from private sources for big initiatives and programs, rather than seeking the council’s approval and going through the city budget. What do you think of this approach? Obviously, I think every city needs that infusion of philanthropic resources. Do I think it’s a good thing to bank on that? Absolutely not. I believe that as mayor, you’ve got to have the ability to work with the policymakers to build consensus. And if you are not capable of that, then it’s more difficult for you to do your job. So to answer your question, I will continue raising philanthropic resources for issues in Oakland, because I think it’s healthy and it gives corporations and gives people the ability to participate and help. But more than anything, I can tell you that as mayor, I will have a relationship with the City Council, the same way that I did when I was there for 20 years. I won’t be a mayor who spends their time fighting with the City Council. I’m a consensus builder. I did it before and I’ll do it again. Before you go... Can you help us make a difference?

We amplify community voices, share the power of real information, and investigate systems, not just symptoms. Donate We’ve invited nine of the 10 people running to be the next mayor of Oakland to sit down with us for in-depth interviews, asking them mostly the same questions. Such as, how many police officers does the Oakland Police Department need? How would they help the City Council and the city administration work together better? How would they fix Oakland’s potholes? We developed these questions with help from hundreds of Oakland residents who answered our election survey this summer; thank you to everyone who weighed in. Oakland mayoral candidate interviews Greg Hodge Seneca Scott Loren Taylor Ignacio De La Fuente Sheng Thao Treva Reid Allyssa Victory John Reimann Tyron Jordan Settle in for a long read; these conversations are weighty, befitting the office these candidates seek. They’ve been edited for length, relevance, and clarity, with some added fact-checking and background reading from us. (And note that we decided not to interview candidate Peter Liu and provide another platform for his dangerous and hateful rhetoric. ) This interview is with Treva Reid, the City Council District 7 representative. Reid previously was a government affairs manager for California Waste Solutions, the city’s recycling contractor, and PG&E. Before that, she was an aide to Nancy Skinner in the California State Assembly. A ministry leader at Shiloh Church, Reid described herself at a recent forum as a “resilient single mother” hailing from a large family of civil servants, faith leaders, and business people who have always centered “taking care of the community.” She is the daughter of former District 7 Councilmember Larry Reid. The City Council often feels like the city administrator isn’t enacting the policies and laws they’ve approved. On the other hand, the city administration’s staff often feels like the City Council is overstepping or loading their plate with too much work. If you were elected mayor, how would you repair this relationship? We have a great opportunity to rebuild trust and relationships between the mayor and the council. We’re in an election year. We’re going to have at least two new councilmembers and a new mayor. As mayor, I would propose a multibillion-dollar budget with priorities for each council district. I would work with each council member to understand what their priorities are, and I would work with them in their districts, engaging in the community. I would work to ensure that the budget that I’m proposing has an equity lens. And as mayor, I would make sure I execute council directives. This does not mean that every priority would be able to be funded or prioritized, particularly in that first year. But there are opportunities to make sure community members and councilmembers feel heard and that we build a more collaborative partnership. I’ve always been a bridge builder. It’s what I was raised to do. You’ve heard my story of my father’s siblings. I’m one of the oldest grandchildren of 130-plus cousins who are amazingly all still alive. And on my mom’s side, there are 50-plus cousins. So I was raised to learn how to navigate a lot of dynamics with personalities and find a path of peace to bring people together. I believe that as a mayor, you work to build off that one connecting point, and if that one connecting point that we have is we need Oakland to recover for all of us, then how do I show up as mayor, aside from any politics, to just deliver for the people we are all called to serve? How do I shepherd that relationship of bridge building, and collaboration, and integrity, and have systems and processes that work where I’m holding my team accountable for results so that it’s not a fight [with the] council because they’ve not seen us show up, they’ve not seen a mayor equitably allocate resources, or seen a mayor direct timely response? That’s what my desire is to do. It’s to allocate equitably. It’s to direct timely response. It’s to make sure we’ve got critical service implementation to deliver. And it’s to make sure we’ve got department leaders in place. Accountability begins with me as mayor in partnership with my administration and the councilmembers. And I believe there’s a term before us where we can see better dynamics aside from politics to show up for people. The public expects better of us. I have seen more deals cut, more of a disservice to our role as leaders, and the polls show it. In East Oakland, those politics have led to disinvestment. Regarding the last budget written by the mayor and approved by the City Council with amendments, was there anything in there that you would have cut as mayor? Did they leave anything out that you feel should have been included? There were a number of things that were missing. If you look at my initial budget memo, we asked for a designated illegal dumping crew [to clean up trash from city streets]. And we asked for an equitable amount of waste cans. Waste cans should not require five votes on the council. Do you mean trash cans on sidewalks? Yes. Illegal dumping and blight in [District 7] is [a big problem]. It’s an issue that we SeeClickFix every day in East Oakland. We asked for priority and a more active response. And a part of that was we also asked for a designed overtime crew. Can we just get a crew that we’re not sharing with the other most impacted district next to us [District 6] to show up and give our community clean, healthy streets in the midst of COVID? People are overwhelmed by the trash and conditions on our streets. And we didn’t see that response. But we did get some garbage blitz crews and other things. I asked for us to also partner more deeply with community-based organizations to fund jobs. That was an amendment we put in the budget to try to build up capacity with community organizations. But as a mayor, I want to see how we can invest more deeply into an area like illegal dumping and blight. How could we create a “Love On Our Town” initiative with programs across the city that focus on just the outdoor living conditions of what’s before us? Even though shootings and homicides are a major threat, the one thing our neighbors say is, “Can you just clean up the streets?” We failed to deliver that more proactive response [in the last budget]. Another area that wasn’t fully invested in was traffic calming and street safety measures. I uplifted a number of specific target areas in East Oakland. Mayor Libby Schaaf has done an exceptional job of raising private money from philanthropic sources to meet some of her big goals rather than going through the city budget. What do you think of this approach? Is it good for Oakland? Is it something you would also do as mayor? As mayor, you have got to identify what the priorities are. And you’ve got to fund those priorities. That will require you to go after every dollar we can get at the local level from our county partner, state partners, federal partners, and philanthropic partners. They should be at the table to help fund our designated priorities. We know the city’s budget will not allow us to address all our needs with the significant amount of restricted funds that come into our budget. [ Editor’s note: Reid that most of the money in Oakland’s budget—62%—is already designated for specific uses and the City Council can’t just reallocate it to other programs. These “restricted” funds come from specific fees, taxes, and other sources, and they can only be spent on a narrow range of things like paying back bond debt or funding the Department of Planning and Building. ] So we do need to find those opportunities to partner outside our ability with the [revenues] we’re bringing into the city. Corporate partners, how do you partner with us if you want to be a part of this community? How do you begin to invest more deeply into our community, into jobs, housing, and education? I believe everyone should be at the table, and we need to determine how those investments can benefit us. I don’t think it should be tied politically. It should be tied to our priorities and how we drive to those priorities. We need to look at more partnerships coming into the city that will uphold our values. Oakland is thousands of units short of meeting the affordable housing goals set by the region and state, the so-called RHNA goals . Would expanding affordable housing in Oakland be a goal of yours? If so, what concrete steps would you take? How would market-rate development and social housing fit into this plan? We know that we have not had an intentional strategy that’s been funded and resourced, and staffed to deliver for us to ensure that affordable housing was something we are moving forward to. There’s been systemic disinvestment from affordable housing, and we need to work to figure out how we invest more deeply. That’s going to come with subsidies and housing vouchers, which I believe the federal government has just been egregious in not participating in those areas. My first home was a $60-a-month subsidized affordable home. As mayor, I would look at how we are investing the dollars to alleviate homelessness. We’ve invested in Measure W and Measure Q and need to audit to understand how we have spent that money and what we have available moving forward. [ Editor’s note: the city auditor is already required to conduct audits of Measure W, a vacant property tax used to fund homelessness services and affordable housing, and Measure Q, a parcel tax used to fund parks and homelessness services. The Measure W audit will begin in January 2023, and the Measure Q audit is currently in progress. ] It’s going to require us to restructure how we’re funding [homelessness services]. We’ve seen the reports where we’ve invested in managing homelessness versus really investing more deeply into bringing people off the streets into housing. We’ve got to look at where and how we utilize our city-owned land and how we prioritize fast-tracking affordable housing projects through the pipeline. Certainly, lack of staff has been a barrier there to ensuring those projects are moving forward, but we’ve had other barriers. [ Editor’s note: Oakland’s Department of Housing and Community Development, which works on affordable housing projects with nonprofit developers, currently has a job vacancy rate of about 27%. Lots of other city departments have similarly high rates of job vacancies. ] We’ve got to increase our rental assistance and our mortgage assistance program. We’ve got to increase the opportunities for people to come into affordable home ownership. [ Editor’s note: Rental assistance during the COVID-19 crisis was made available with state and federal funds, but the program is no longer accepting applications. The city mortgage assistance program for first-time homebuyers is currently suspended for lack of funding. ] We’ve got to make sure we’re building more multifamily dwellings. We’re talking ADUs and modular homes and creating an innovative path of housing. I’ve been on a Black regional housing task force looking at where we haven’t had targeted investments for our Black community members in this region. We know that those who are living and experiencing homelessness are over 60% Black. We’ve got to find targeted and intentional ways to address the needs of those who have been inequitably impacted by this crisis. And we’ve got a path, a “PATH framework.” [ Editor’s note: the PATH framework is a city strategy to reduce homelessness. ] But it needs to be funded. It needs to be invested in. How are we investing in it, making sure we have targeted funds and that we call on the state to invest with us? We need to call on our county partners to invest with us. The health and welfare and life stability [of residents] fall under the responsibility of our county. They should come to the table to support us. What other policies and programs would you pursue to help get the 5,000 unhoused people into shelters and off our streets? The Homekey program is an opportunity. We have properties that we’re trying to bring back into funding consideration that missed the mark with the administration’s prioritizing in phase one. The administration created a layer of an RFP process that caused there to be a delay in our submission for state Homekey funds, and we missed phase one funds. That was a critical challenge for us to realize that we added a bureaucratic layer that wasn’t necessary, and we were at the back of the line in receiving funding. In my district, we had a senior housing development we hoped to get funded. I served on the board of Satellite Affordable Housing Associates . We know it takes a lot of funding and time to get those projects built up. So that was a project that we missed out on state funding for. And we also missed out on [another application], which put that project in jeopardy again. We’ve got to make sure that on the administrative level, we have projects ready to go and we don’t create layers of bureaucracy that impede us from competing. I also think the funding system is not favorable for us. I don’t believe Oakland should compete with Humboldt County or San Mateo County for homeless and housing funds. There should be another type of system for cities like ours that are experiencing the crisis of homelessness and the need to secure housing at a different level than some of our counties and jurisdictions across the state. [ Editor’s note: San Mateo County is estimated to have at least 1,808 homeless residents, while Humboldt County has about 1,402 homeless residents. Alameda County has 9,747 homeless residents. ] I believe there’s an opportunity to work with our state senator and assembly members to advance a change in the funding system where it can benefit Oakland and other cities like San Jose, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego. The EIFD is something we’re also progressing on. We’re supposed to get a report back in the coming month to understand how the enhanced infrastructure financing district can be a benefit to us and what we can gain in those increased tax revenues in different parts of the city to increase housing. [Editor’s note: The EIFD , which was proposed by councilmembers Sheng Thao, Nikki Fortunato Bas, and Carroll fife, would use growth in future property tax revenues to fund affordable housing construction. ] Do you support the EIFD or are you waiting on that report to make up your mind about it? I support progress [on reviewing its feasibility]. We’re all waiting to hear back about how it can be a benefit. When that report comes back in November, I’ll be able to tell you more. A few weeks back, there were fires along the 580. You and other elected officials went to the scene during the first one. We noticed a video you posted in which you connected that fire to homeless camps at that location. To our knowledge, the fire department still hasn’t determined a cause or said whether there were homeless camps there. Can you clarify what was your thought process there? We’ve not heard back about the final investigative report on that fire. I shared with you what was told to me when I came onto the scene from what I understood the impact of that fire was assumed to be. We know that too many people live along our highways and underpasses, and that’s not where anyone should live. We shouldn’t allow dangerous living conditions outdoors. I step in as a leader and say it’s unacceptable [whatever the cause of the fire ultimately is] that there are people living on the sides of our highways, up in the brush. We see them. We see the tents on exit ramps and on-ramps, and we’ve got to do better to bring humanity and dignity to our neighbors. Residents have noted the lack of large grocery stores with fresh produce in Oakland, particularly in West and East Oakland. How will you work with those areas’ councilmembers to create more grocery stores with better, healthier options? COVID has certainly impacted that. There have been significant delays with ordering parts and supplies to maintain our public safety vehicles. As mayor, I would support the procurement of local goods and local foods. How do we build up a local economy of manufacturing and supply for us to rely more deeply on? Where are the opportunities to ensure more of those things we were relying on [from national suppliers], that we can build that capacity here? Who do we have in this area that we could be doing more business with? Treva Reid speaking at a mayoral candidates forum in August. Credit: Amir Aziz Residents have noted the lack of large grocery stores with fresh produce in Oakland, particularly in West and East Oakland. How will you work with those areas’ councilmembers to create more grocery stores with better, healthier options? We have FoodMax and FoodsCo now at Foothill and Durant, but Oakland residents are struggling significantly with poor nutrition and a lack of access. Food deserts are a public health crisis. It’s a lack of access to affordable food and a burden on households like those in East Oakland who are also experiencing issues like paying high rent, covering transportation costs, affording health care, and sustaining good employment opportunities. Inflation inflames these issues more. Since I’ve come into office, we’ve partnered with food co-ops. We partnered with Saba Grocers and went out to those stores in our communities to understand the needs and opportunities to invest more deeply. We’ve got new coops coming up, like DEEP Grocery Coop . In West Oakland, we’ve got Mandela Grocery , which I used to visit frequently when I worked there for over a decade. We’ve got partnerships we can build up with our county food bank, and OUSD has a central kitchen. One of the things we did through Alameda County Public Health nutrition services was run a healthy retail program. While we’re working to build out more healthy food options—whether that’s grocery stores or investing more deeply into local retail stores, or partnering with small neighborhoods markets, those that can be walked to that are more convenient and accessible to seniors and youth in underserved neighborhoods that lack healthy food—it’s working with them to incentivize our neighbors to have fresh fruits and vegetables on demand but also to incentivize them to purchase those foods that are healthier as they’re shopping. We had seven stores in East Oakland that got about $3,000 in coupons. We distributed these coupons to customers, whoever they saw fit. We had door hangers on people’s homes to encourage neighbors to make purchases at their local stores. And we had health and wellness-nutrition classes. Just to clarify, who paid for the grocery coupon program? It was paid for by the county: It helped people be able to afford to choose fruits and vegetables over snacks or other things. People want to buy better, but often the prices are too high, or it’s too difficult. Why let someone go hungry or make unhealthy choices when we can help provide better options? One other thing we’ve done in East Oakland—and it’s an approach we can build on across the city—is a partnership with Homies Empowerment . We’ve given them access to develop surplus land if you’ve not gone there yet. It used to be a hotel that had a lot of crime and prostitution, and drugs at one time, but that hotel was torn down. Now on that 20,000 square feet of land, we have the Freedom Farm . The goal is to provide food for over 300 families. We can utilize our public land by working with organizations like Homies Empowerment and others across the town. That land is scheduled to have affordable housing on it, but until it’s built, we can work with these community organizations on the ground to address food deserts. You represent D7 which is home to Oakland’s fast-growing Latino community. When you were elected, you told us the city hadn’t done the best job of connecting with Latinos. In what ways have you effectively served the Latino community, and where could you have done better? It begins with representation. From the beginning, I’ve had staff representing the communities I serve in East Oakland. So I’ve had staff be a point of contact for our Spanish-speaking communities to be heard and seen. We’ve held 15 town halls and had Spanish interpretation to ensure everyone can engage. We’ve worked on the ground to make sure our Spanish-speaking business owners [are heard]. Every month we do walks, we door-knock to understand what the issues are, and we talk about programs and partnerships. We talk about our business assistance center at the library. We’re out on the ground with our neighbors to meet them where they are. We do a day of action with up to 30 organizations where we come together with city and county partners to deliver for the community. We do it with organizations that have deeper relationships and more street cred, perhaps than our office on the ground, like the Latino Taskforce . So we learn from them to understand what the community needs. It’s making sure they’re involved in the budget, that our City Council meetings are accessible, and that there’s funding for communities. Readers who took our election survey wanted us to ask about police staffing. Oakland has 681 officers right now. Is that too few or too many? Can you explain your thinking? Well, it’s below our budgeted amount. It’s too few based on the fact that we’ve budgeted more police resources with sworn officers. We’ve yet to fill those seats. So we’ve got to do a better job of how we’re recruiting and retaining our sworn officers and to invest more deeply into every area of public safety resources. [ Editor’s note: The City Council has budgeted for 752 officers, but the police department has only been able to staff 681 officer positions due to difficulties recruiting and training new officers and the rate at which the department loses its current officers to retirement and for other reasons. ] I have mostly heard from neighbors that they want more [police] resources, not less. At the time I came into office, we had 400 [911] calls pending on nights, and no [police officers] were there to respond. We heard at the time that the data showed that Black women were calling OPD the most and were retraumatized because [OPD] didn’t have anyone there to respond to them. So having an efficient number of sworn officers, getting up to our budgeted level, and recruiting more Oakland-grown officers who understand and are accountable to our trauma-informed and constitutional policing [policies], who understand the culture and have been part of the community, and who will uplift our motto of “Love Life” even in their public service commitment, that is important. But we know it’s really hard to hire police officers. The process is grueling, and we’re constantly losing police officers. Is there anything new we could do to increase police staffing to the budgeted level? I believe that as we come together [under my] administration, between the mayor and council partnering more deeply on public safety and that collective, more unified approach to strategies and solutions, we’ll also create a more welcoming environment for those [police recruits] who may not be considering Oakland right now. I know a lot of work is going into recruiting and retaining officers. We’ve given council directives in that area and see that the academies have been more diverse under Chief Armstrong. [ Editor’s note: The City Council has directed the administration to hire officers from more diverse backgrounds, including more women and people of color. ] As mayor, I would build on that. [I will] be open and honest and transparent about how we’re approaching public safety and how we’re engaging our community, and working with our inspector general, and working with our community citizens boards, and police commission, that will also be a part of what we create as a culture for public safety and policing. Gun violence is one of the most pressing issues our city faces. What’s your plan to reduce gun violence? Do you think Ceasefire is working? Did it go off the rails somewhere, and how do you get it back on track? What about the Department of Violence Prevention? Would you invest more in DVP, and if so, how much? It’s going to take a number of different approaches. When I came onto the council, I declared gun violence a public health crisis . That [resolution] not only called on the city to make deeper investments in violence prevention, intervention, healing, and trauma care—like Ceasefire, and like MACRO, and building on those Reimagining Public Safety Task Force goals—but it also called on us to have our county partner and community-based organizations to show up with us. The county needs to utilize its funding more intentionally in public safety investments in Oakland. We need deeper investments in violence prevention programs and partnerships, culturally responsive mental health services, additional community clinic providers to support more holistic health services, the county investing with us in rental support, homeowner retention, affordable housing development, [all to get] to the root causes [of gun violence]. We also need more investment in life coaching and living wage jobs in the region and city. We need support for technical assistance for Black and brown businesses. We need to enhance economic self-sufficiency and expand workforce development and business assistance programs. But it also calls on us to invest in public safety. We should have at least four police academies. [ Editor’s note: the last budget approved by council included four police academies. Council later amended this to include two additional police academies for a total of six. ] We need to double our investment in the Department of Violence Prevention. DVP asked for $40 million. We’ve got to work to build on strategies that are funded. We’ve got good plans, but they are not funded. Where we lack the funding to meet these investment goals, we’ve got to call on our state and federal partners to come show up with us. We have incredible partnerships with the state budget chair, a leader I’ve fortunately had an opportunity to work for, Nancy Skinner, when she was the assembly budget chair. She’s now the senate budget chair. When we worked in the state assembly, there were ways she crafted a budget that allowed us to have funding formulas that benefitted cities like Oakland. Oakland was in line to receive significant dollars for public safety at that time. We’d like to expand MACRO. I want to see MACRO expanded 24/7. [ Editor’s note: MACRO is currently a pilot program in which civilians will eventually respond to nonviolent 911 calls, but the MACRO teams currently don’t take many 911 calls and they don’t respond to calls around the clock, and the MACRO teams only work in a few areas of the city. ] I want to see other technology tools utilized in the city. There’s going to be an opportunity with a new mayor to really look at our public safety system as we’re reimagining it, to look at where we’re investing, how we can invest differently, and more to show up with a real response on the ground to meet the crisis that’s before us, and address the unchecked lawlessness that is wreaking havoc across the town. During the last budget cycle, there was a conflict that boiled down to whether we should give the police department an extra $18 million to fund 911 surge units and other things or put that money in the Department of Violence Prevention. If there appears to be a similarly limited pot of money in the next budget cycle and the question is more or less the same, what will you do? Fund OPD a little more, or fund DVP or MACRO? What’s your budget going to look like? My budget is going to look like investing in OPD and DVP. We’re going to have to look at where we are with the budget to get that done. Do we have to make sure we have resources on the ground to respond to our community? Absolutely. We have to make sure those positions that are budgeted are filled. [ Editor’s note: The budget Reid supported in 2021 did not include an additional investment of $18 million in the Department of Violence Prevention. Reid supported Schaaf’s plan to use this funding to pay for two additional police academies, maintain OPD’s 911 surge units, and pay for up to two police traffic squads. ] We’ve got another [OPD academy] that just started with 30 [police trainees], another that has started with about 25 [trainees], and another that’s coming up. We’ve got to continue to progress, ensuring we have a culturally diverse and inclusive officer force, criminal investigators, Ceasefire, and 911 response officers. And we need to also make sure that historic investment into DVP does not stop in one year after one [budget] cycle. Some of that funding is just going out the door. We’re just beginning to assess and realize how that work is going to benefit us. [ Editor’s note: the funding Reid is referring to here are grants from DVP to nonprofits that are carrying out violence prevention services in the community, including life coaching, counseling, emergency responses to violent incidents to de-escalate and prevent retaliation, and much more. DVP is handing out about $19 million in grants to dozens of organizations. ] You asked about Ceasefire . Ceasefire fell off for a moment. It did fall off in COVID . The city couldn’t do call-ins. It couldn’t be responsive in the ways we had seen success before to address, and target strategies for those [individuals] we know have been involved in a number of incidents of crime and redirect them to opportunities and resources to engage them away from that life of crime. Whether it’s emergency rehousing or workforce training, what’s needed is getting to the root of the issues they’re facing. That’s needed. When we’re looking at two schools that have been impacted by gun violence and a mass shooting here in East Oakland, you’ve got to have that investment in healing and trauma care. We’ve not invested in communities that have lived from one generation to the next terrorized and traumatized by violence. So as we’re talking about investment into DVP, that’s an investment that also includes school safety funding. We put $2.4 million into restorative justice measures and violence interrupter partnerships with the schools to put clinicians there to support our students. I won’t just depend on our city budget. We know that our city budget is limited. That’s where we get to work with our federal and state partners. There was a grant at the federal level that we had received in years past [but we didn’t receive this last year] because of freezing positions. That was a federal grant of some sort for our police department? Yes. Public Schools in Oakland are run by OUSD and charter management organizations. But that hasn’t stopped Mayor Schaaf from including education as one of her platforms with programs like Oakland Undivided, Oakland Promise, and the Teacher Residency Program. What do you think the mayor’s role should be in getting involved in public education issues in Oakland? Oakland’s public education issues are all of our issues. We have a number of education crises. I chair the city’s education partnership to partner with OUSD to ensure we deliver an equitable path of academic enrichment programs and overcome equity gaps. [ Editor’s note: The City Council’s Education Partnership Committee includes councilmembers and OUSD directors and helps coordinate the city with the school district. ] As mayor, I would make sure there’s continuing access to technology, make sure there’s stable housing and nutritious food for our children who are growing. [I would also make sure] we have internship programs that we are supporting. One of the things I did when I came onto the City Council, in this last midcycle budget, was to invest in a transportation rideshare partnership through the OK Program , which is going to be the partner we lead this through. What led to this was there was an issue, a football practice at Castlemont High School, where Skyline High School players were coming onto the field, and someone shot off a gun; bullet rounds went off. This was during COVID. This was the one safe place students had to go to, where they could connect, get outside, and have this healthy place. That day left them traumatized. That was the same day of the murder at Concordia Park , where a coach was killed in front of his children. [In response] I began going to school to pick the students up and take them home after practice. I realized it wasn’t sustainable for me to try to do that. We had called on the OK Program to bring vans to help us. We realized there was going to be more support needed, so we’re now $45,000 into a partnership with a rideshare service that supports youth, giving access to free rides so they can get home following their afterschool programs at McClymonds and Castlemont. That’s one approach I will build on. That $45,000 was a private investment or city funding? Private and city. From the city, I was able to secure $25,000 and then $20,000 from a private partner. There’s also an apprentice trade program. Youth workforce development opportunities under my administration will be essential to connect students with apprenticeships at the port, with tech careers, and some jobs that may not require a college degree. Some are partnerships with the trades. I worked to secure a much larger investment into a trades program at Castlemont to build a pipeline for students who have interests in non-college degree tracks. Both the Coliseum and Arena are huge entertainment hubs for the city. Regardless of what the A’s end up doing, going to Howard Terminal or leaving the city altogether, what do you envision for the future of the Coliseum and Arena site? The Coliseum has a lot of opportunities to be developed. We are in partnership with the African American Sports and Entertainment Group , founded by local owners who are deeply invested in working in partnership with community-driven processes and making sure the community is at the table. It’s 100-plus acres, and we want to build out the vision that has been presented between the community’s interest and AASEG. They’ve talked about what that looks like with bringing a pipeline of 30,000 jobs, workforce development, school mentorships, deeply affordable housing at that transit corridor, perhaps a university satellite campus, a Black-owned business district, banks that serve the community, hotels, retail shops, opportunities for generational wealth to be created in a community that we are working to prioritize and preserve from further displacement. That project can be an economic engine that revitalizes the Coliseum and the communities around it. There’s been a plan in place since 2014, the Coliseum Specific Plan , and we now have a partner who we’re working with. We need to ensure it does so with a lens of equity and priority for the surrounding community. A jobs benefit agreement and community benefits agreement [is important]. I worked on that type of agreement at the Oakland Army Base when I worked for a private company at that time. It’s making sure we ensure there are environmental justice priorities. [ Editor’s note: a jobs agreement would ensure that whoever develops the Coliseum area hires locally, pays well, and recruits Oakland residents for trainee or apprentice positions. A community benefits agreement would ensure that a variety of things in the project are a benefit to the surrounding community, including possibly affordable housing or subsidized commercial space for nonprofits. ] As the AB 617 [committee] is moving from West Oakland into East Oakland, we need to make sure [the Coliseum] development has that lens and that we don’t displace residents or local businesses. [ Editor’s note: AB 617 was a state bill that created a community-led committee in West Oakland with the power to study air pollution’s impact on neighborhoods and make recommendations for reducing air pollution. ] Oakland spends millions each year through the city budget on the arts. Is this something the city should do, or are there bigger priorities? Arts and culture are a part of our city. We need to look at where and how we’re investing.  I tried to secure more specific funding for communities like East Oakland, where we don’t see a lot of vitality in our arts culture. We could have this “Love on Our town” initiative that’s not just about investing in a culture of cleanliness, but it is about investing in the culture of Oakland. I went recently to the Center for ArtEsteem’s grand opening for their new property, and we talked about the opportunity to raise up local youth artists and create a space through art and STEAM initiatives to give our children an opportunity to heal, create, and innovate. I believe we should invest in more of those opportunities. I believe we could invest more in beautification, into graffiti cleanup. We should look into where those dollars can come from outside of the city budget. We have not had a grant writer. I think there’s an opportunity to tap into more grants. Part of that is having staff that can be an extension to get funding for us outside of the city’s budget so that we’re not in conflict trying to compete for something that is important, even though when you look at the scheme of what our community members are driving for—their priorities are homelessness, housing, public safety, illegal dumping, and blight. And we have to preserve cultural landmarks. We have to make sure we have funding to maintain them and keep them beautiful and not have our unhoused people in places where those works of art have been established. Will it take priority over public safety or homelessness? I don’t believe it has to compete. I believe we can find the funding that we need to uplift arts and culture in the city. Before you go...

Donate Feel like you don’t know much about the 10 people running to be Oakland’s next mayor? You’re not alone. In the race to replace outgoing mayor Libby Schaaf, who served the maximum eight years allowed in Oakland, the candidates with the greatest name recognition are relatively new to Oakland politics or haven’t held elected office in years. And in certain corners of the internet, you’d be forgiven for thinking that Howard Terminal is all Oakland’s next mayor will think about over the next four years. Everything you need to know: A guide to Oakland’s Nov. 8 general election At The Oaklandside, we firmly believe that journalism—and especially local journalism—is part of democracy’s bedrock. To uphold that promise, we’re steering clear of the notion that there are only two or three candidates worth your attention or that Oakland’s next mayor can’t or won’t accomplish much. Instead, we’ve invited nine of the 10 candidates to sit down with us for in-depth interviews, asking them mostly the same questions, such as, how many police officers does the Oakland Police Department need? How would they help the City Council and the city administration work together better? How would they fix Oakland’s potholes? We developed these questions with help from hundreds of Oakland residents who answered our election survey this summer; thank you to everyone who weighed in. (And no, we didn’t ask about Howard Terminal; they’ll get plenty of that elsewhere.) Settle in for a long read; these conversations are weighty, befitting the office these candidates seek. They’ve been lightly edited for clarity, with added fact-checking from us in some places. (And note that we made the decision not to interview candidate Peter Liu so as not to provide another platform for his dangerous and hateful rhetoric. ) Oakland mayoral candidate interviews Greg Hodge Seneca Scott Loren Taylor Ignacio De La Fuente Sheng Thao Treva Reid Allyssa Victory John Reimann Tyron Jordan We’re kicking this series off with Greg Hodge, who, as we reported previously, is a social entrepreneur and licensed attorney. Hodge operates Khepera Consulting and is involved in several community organizations, including the Brotherhood of Elders Network , which works to advance the health and wellness of Black men and boys. He served two terms on the Oakland Unified School District board from 2001 to 2009 and was board president from 2003 to 2005. —Tasneem Raja, editor-in-chief, The Oaklandside Over the last few years, we’ve seen several examples of tension between the City Council and the city administration. For instance, the city’s homeless encampment management policy—the council passed it, but many feel the city administration isn’t enacting it. The rocky establishment of the Oakland Police Commission is another example. As mayor, you’d be the city administrator’s boss. How would you help the City Council and the city administration work together better? Last year, I was a facilitator for the City Council’s biannual retreat, and the retreat focused on two things: Budget priorities for this next budget cycle, and the working relationships between the City Council, the mayor, the city administrator, the city attorney, as well as the [Alameda County] Board of Education and the Board of Supervisors. I interviewed each person, including the mayor—45-minute interviews—and I had a chance to hear from all of them. And to a person, they all described the working relationships as poor to none. Some of them said that they didn’t meet on a regular basis with the current mayor. The city administrator said part of the problem is that there are no agreed-upon priorities and the council tends to give his staff more and more work, and they don’t take anything off of the plate. Councilmembers expressed frustration with the city administrator, saying he does not pay attention to where our priorities are. So if there’s a fundamental breakdown in the communication, I think it’s the mayor’s role to work with the City Council to write the budget priorities. And in this cycle it’s going to be safety, it’s going to be homelessness, it’s going to be illegal dumping—there are going to be several things. And there are a lot of other things that city staff will just not be able to do. So part of the challenge is to get to a fundamental agreement about the priorities? And then, what is the staffing capacity to follow through? And when you prioritize something, does that mean you’re saying no to something else? What I found in these conversations is that most of them had a long list of priorities. And in the session, I explained to them that a priority is something that, by definition, excludes something else. So you’ve got to take something off your list. Lastly, the city administrator had a dashboard idea for tracking and providing metrics for the places where we’ve made advancements, and I don’t think that has happened: having a tool that actually measures success on given priorities and is making sure that there is capacity within city government to actually handle those priorities. In the current budget that was drafted by the mayor and passed by the council—I’m sure you’re familiar with much of what was in it—was there anything left out that you would have liked to have been included? And anything included that you disagree with? One thing that I think should have been bolstered was the budget for the Department of Violence Prevention. That department now, I think, is budgeted at around $20 million. In my opinion, it should be double that. I think one of the ways that we could handle it, at least in the previous cycle, is if we had avoided that $3 million of overtime that was overspent for OPD.  That money should have been put into the Department of Violence Prevention. The vision behind the Department of Violence Prevention was that it was going to have equal status with the police department—and there’s no way budgetarily that’s going to happen anytime soon. But I think, year in and year out, you’ve got to put more prevention dollars, behavioral health dollars, and fidelity toward the model done in Richmond. Richmond’s office of neighborhood safety was put together back in 2008—I was one of three consultants to help do that. Within five years, Richmond’s homicide rate came down 70%. And it was because one of the central features was, they hired returning citizens, formerly incarcerated folks who are from Richmond, to interact with and work with the young people who were identified shooters. That’s the hard work, that effort. So I think budget-wise, you’ve got to add more to DVP’s budget. It’s hard to say what I would take out [of the city budget] because most of the things that I noticed in the budget were actually pretty meaningful. If anything, you have to really take a look at the pet projects each City Council person has in their district—the kinds of things that go into those projects, where people give a grant to a community organization for some work they’re doing. We don’t have the luxury of doing that as much anymore. I get the politics—that people want to feel like they delivered for their districts. But those dollars, I want to say it’s a total of $50 million across all councilmembers—I may be getting the number wrong—that’s a place where you’ve got to have a little bit more discipline to say, “We’re in a crisis, and we have to focus every single resource on how we’re addressing those big crisis issues.” Now, if that pork is being used in a way that’s consistent with the priorities of the full City Council, then it makes sense to me. Otherwise, we just don’t have the luxury to do the sort of pet projects, if you will, that lots of councilmembers like to do. Oakland is thousands of units short of meeting the affordable housing goals set by the region and the state. Would expanding affordable housing in Oakland be a priority of yours as mayor? And if so, what are some concrete steps would you take to achieve that? It’s absolutely a priority. Housing is a human right and we’ve done a really unconscionable job of allowing 5,000 people to be living on the streets without the proper infrastructure or services. From a racial equity perspective, 70% of all Oakland’s unhoused are African American, and many of them are seniors. It is a situation that we wouldn’t wish upon our worst enemies, to be honest with you. [Editor’s note: Seventy percent of Oakland’s unhoused residents in 2019 were African American. The percentage declined to 59% in a 2022 count.] So I think we have to take the framework that the city has adopted—along with EBHO (East Bay Housing Organization) and others—this notion of production, preservation, and protection. On the protection side, we’ve got to ensure that we protect the 47%, the 209,000 rent-burdened folks here in Oakland. We’ve got to maintain and strengthen the Just Cause eviction framework, we’ve got to reinstate the Oakland Mortgage Assistance Program, and we’ve got to maintain and protect Oakland rent adjustments at the 3% cap. And I think we need to create an emergency assistance network that works with Oakland Housing Authority and with legal assistance programs to provide legal protections for people who are fighting evictions. On the production side, we need to set big goals that we can attain. This is a regional problem—cities don’t solve this problem alone. You make sure that you’re working with the county, you’re working with ABAG (Association of Bay Area Governments), and other regional entities. One specific idea: There is a proposal that was forwarded back in March of last year with BARHII (Bay Area Regional Health Inequities Initiative) and others that was called the Black Hat Fund. It was $500 million for first-time homeowner assistance and included resources for people of color-driven or owned nonprofit developers to get homes. And then you add to that what San Francisco and other cities have tried to do around their Community Opportunity to Purchase Act, where you’re giving right of first refusal to nonprofit organizations to buy those properties, and then sell those properties back at market rate or below market to folks that are looking to buy. Lastly, you have to protect the 20,000 folks in low-income homes. You’ve got to do a registry so we know where rental properties are and what prices are being charged. We’ve got to adopt a tenant opportunity to purchase that goes along with that community opportunity to purchase piece. Then, make sure that we can build as many ADUs as possible without some of the bureaucratic barriers. We need to make it easy to do business in Oakland. Our permitting process, everything over there is just antiquated. It takes way too long to get things through, and I think we can do a much better job. What is your perspective on the role of market-rate housing development, and social housing, in addressing the housing crisis? I think it needs to be balanced. I think that when we think about equity concerns around how we do market-rate, and how we vet those projects with the public, typically we wait a little bit too long in the process to ask neighbors what they think. So part of what we’ve got to do is [work with] developers who have pursued their development projects, but with an equity lens. Obviously, there is a financial connection between tax increment funds that you get from those developments, and the ability to build affordable and very affordable housing. We need to have a more comprehensive approach to this. We need to get all the stakeholders, the nonprofit developers or private developers and others, at the table early on to think through what a community-benefits ordinance will look like, so we’re not negotiating community benefits for every single project. Essentially, create a system around this as opposed to a set of transactions. That, for me, is the theme of my campaign. We’ve had too many years of political transactions at City Hall. We talk about systems transformation, but nobody is willing politically to shake up the systems because the only people who run for mayor are running for something else after that. And it’s hard to make hard choices when you are always sort of testing the political winds about your next thing. You referenced the 5,000 people living on the street. What specific policies and programs would you pursue as mayor to get people off the streets? And particularly, how would you balance some of these pressing safety concerns like fires associated with encampments, with the community pleas to not criminalize people who are trying to survive out there? As I said at the outset of this, it’s unconscionable that we have this many people living on the streets. So I think the first thing we do is stop homelessness before it starts, with prevention services. It goes back to parts of my answer to your previous question around: How do we make sure that we’re protecting low-income and affordable and very affordable housing for our most vulnerable Oaklanders? I think we’ve got to make sure that we reach the folks with the lowest incomes, providing housing support for families, seniors, and people with disabilities. And then we’ve got to make sure that people have the right set of services. When they do the point-in-time count, they ask people, “Why are you out here?” And about 67% of the reason is financial. People say, “I lost my job and I didn’t have my last month of rent,” or “My car broke down, so I couldn’t get to work, and then I lost my job, so now I live in my car.” And then about 37 or 34% of it is mental health issues and substance abuse. [ Editor’s note: The 2022 count in Alameda County found that 18.6% surveyed said mental health needs was the primary cause of their homelessness, while 38.7% said services could have helped. ] So if we could get to those mental health interventions in partnership with the county, where most of our behavioral and mental health dollars sit, then we can do a much better job. We need to revisit the Encampment Management Policy and we need to make sure that we’re implementing it in a way that’s humane. I went out to Wood Street last week and spent time out there as they were cleaning that first section between 34th and 28th streets and Wood. And literally, I get there, and they’re destroying a tiny home. The court settlement that the judge directed said that you’re supposed to [clear encampments] in a humane way—you’re supposed to store people’s belongings, you’re supposed to make sure that people have access to their belongings, and they have reasonable notice before you start removing folks. So while I agree with the necessity of it in that case, because the fires that were happening under the maze were dangerous for everybody, on that particular day, I didn’t see any city staff. I saw eight or nine California Highway Patrol officers. I saw folks driving bulldozers. I didn’t see anybody from the city. The only people I saw helping folks at that moment were from Community Ready Corps, APTP, and other organizations. They had a little tent set up and a woman named Boots. She was helping people solve problems. One person had a U-haul truck to move their things, and CHP intervened and said a bad credit card was involved. And it was like, how would you even notice? So they had to go through a whole thing around who was going to rent the truck. And then, once you got the truck and those belongings out of there, where are you going to take it? And they were problem-solving around public storage and warehouse facilities where people could store their goods. I didn’t see anybody from the city. I’m not saying they weren’t out there at some point. But as a neighbor—I live in West Oakland—I went over, brought some water, and did the little bit that I could do. And I didn’t see city staff; I didn’t see people really, you know, being able to help folks get to the next place. The last thing I’ll say is, some of the people I talked to [at Wood Street] were saying, “We don’t have any place to go.” The city is saying to go to a shelter where you’ve got a cot in a room with a bunch of other people. But you can’t take your belongings. You can’t take your dog if you have one. You can’t take your kids. And every night you’re there for one night, and you’ve got to get up in the morning and leave and go someplace else. That’s not a tenable solution. And I just think that our city government—with $4.7 million from the state and whatever existing resources—could have done a much better job handling that situation. One of the biggest challenges business owners say they’re dealing with is the rising cost of goods due to global supply chain issues. Have you thought about any local solutions to remedying this national problem? You know, to be honest, really, I have not. I mean, that’s almost like asking, “Well, how do we deal with unbridled capitalism?” It’s this huge question. I’d be open to local business folks talking about alternative supply chain sources. I think it takes years, if not decades, to rearrange what we’re getting from China and what we’re getting from other supply nations. Even the simple things like, you know, semiconductors and the lack of semiconductors, was two years ago for new cars. So I don’t know that you necessarily have a local solution as much as you have, maybe, partnerships with our congressional delegation, our state delegation, to figure out: Are there some ways we can deal with those supply chain problems at the state and national level? That’s probably about the best answer I can give you on that. In our reader surveys, residents have noted the lack of large grocery stores with fresh produce in Oakland, particularly in West Oakland and East Oakland. How will you work with the council members in these areas to create more grocery stores with better, healthier options? It’s a huge issue, and it’s been an issue for a while. As I mentioned before, I live in West Oakland, and I ran for City Council back in 2008. And that was one of the issues I ran on. Our councilperson at that time had been in office for four terms, I think, and we still didn’t have a full-service grocery store in West Oakland. We got Community Foods, which lasted for three years; I think it closed about six months ago. And it was an option, but it wasn’t the most economical option. Because I would try to shop there and, honestly, as a middle-class shopper, I found that paying like $3 for a mango was pretty pricey, you know? And so part of it is, we’ve got to find the right partner on this, whether it’s a Sprouts or, you know, somebody who seems to have good community engagement with folks when they move into a community. I would be very happy to work with folks. Walmart left East Oakland—we lost a grocery in that form. This has been an ongoing issue. For years, people would say, “Well, the reason retailers don’t locate in working-class communities is because of shoplifting,” that sort of thing. And there have been plenty of studies that were done—when I was doing my policy work at Urban Strategies Council and other places—that said that’s just simply not true. And transportation issues are associated with it too. If you’ve got limited transportation in my neighborhood, your choice now is Mandela Market, which is great. But if you live in other parts of West Oakland you’ve got to get up to Emeryville to the Pak ‘n Save or up to Broadway and 30th Street to Sprouts. And the same kind of thing exists in East Oakland. This is one of the reasons why I scratch my head a little bit, literally and figuratively, around current City Council members who are running and say they’ve done all this great stuff, but they haven’t addressed some of the real basic issues that people have in their own districts. We’re going to pivot now to talk about arts and culture. Yay, one of my favorite areas! Both the Coliseum and the Oakland Arena are huge entertainment hubs for the city. If the A’s moved to Howard Terminal, or if they ended up leaving, what do you envision for the future of the Coliseum marina site? I think the Coliseum/arena site should have been the first choice for the A’s. All the infrastructure, the BART line, the freeway, the parking, everything is there. And I think there should have been a lot more effort to make that more attractive. That being said, the African American Sports Entertainment Group, with Rebecca Kaplan and others, has proposed a WNBA franchise. I think all that makes sense and that we need to turn the arena and the Coliseum into a multiplex—sort of like the area in and around Yerba Buena Gardens over in San Francisco, where you’ve got theaters and you’ve got other entertainment venues. I’d love to see a bowling alley, a skating rink—make it a destination. I think the A’s still have 50% ownership equity of that facility, and it needs to be part of the deal with Howard Terminal. Those two things need to be talked about in the same breath, as a part of the same negotiation. And I think that same kind of cooperation that the Fishers and others have had at Howard Terminal, AASEG didn’t get that. I had a conversation with Ray [Bobbit, founder of AASEG] about just the ridiculous barriers that got thrown up, as they were negotiating the ENA (Exclusive Negotiating Agreement). And one of the things he said to me was, [the city] wanted [AASEG] to agree to a confidentiality statement to not talk about the project in public. They didn’t agree to it. But just the fact that the city administration—and I’m gonna take it all the way up the chain and say Mayor Libby Schaaf—would even ask for that, [shows that] they basically were trying to impede any real progress on it. And so I feel like the same amount of energy, the same amount of public conversation that we put in Howard Terminal, ought to be put into the Coliseum complex—have a vision for what that looks like. I know that folks in D6 and D7 have already started talking about it, and organizing around it. But I think that folks deserve that, and we deserve to have the economic spinoff from that. And the last thing I’ll say, one of my friends, and I have to still confirm this, but he said that from the time the Coliseum and Oracle arena got built until today, it has generated $9 billion of wealth for the various franchises. And most of that wealth has not been felt by the people in D6 and D7. And that’s an understatement. Oakland spends a few million a year on arts and culture through the city budget, should the city be funding the arts directly? Or are their bigger priorities? I think the city should be funding an arts director and we should be putting a lot more energy into arts districts like the Black Culture Zone and the Black Arts District. I’ve felt like this for a long time. I’m an artist, a musician, and I’ve spent a lot of time, from the late-80s until recently, at the Malonga Center. I feel that all of these facilities, like Malonga Center, should be world-class spaces. [The Malonga Center] is an Oakland Parks and Recreation-operated building that’s fundamentally falling down around itself. I’ve got friends who are tenants on those upper floors and have studios on the lower floors, and it’s been ignored. I know that Councilmember Carroll Fife has just started to pay attention to what’s going on over there. But the artists in that building are a good example of how arts make a big difference in this community. It is, in fact, part of what makes us feel safer. I think that cities like Philadelphia and the mural arts they have as part of their city work—I mean, it changes the environment and how people feel about their physical space. So better investment in the cultural arts division and more investment in arts districts all over the city, so that every neighborhood has some artistic place. Lastly, working in partnership with Oakland Unified, there ought to be artists in residence in every single school so that young people can get exposure to the visual arts and spoken word. I’m a parent of two Oakland kids who are now adults who are working artists, and they have done great things. But we’ve got to make sure that artists can afford to live here. My children are doing quite well, but they live in Los Angeles because they say it’s just too expensive. Part of it is fit—my oldest is a Marvel writer, so her work is in L.A.—but the arts and culture connection in Oakland can be much stronger, and I think it could actually benefit the entire city and become part of our economic engine. Public schools in Oakland are run by OUSD and various charter school organizations. But Mayor Libby Schaaf has made education a big component of her work through efforts like Oakland Undivided, Oakland Promise, and the teacher residency program. What role should the mayor play in Oakland’s public education issues? Thank you for the question. It is near and dear to my heart. I spent eight years on the Oakland school board and have a pretty decent understanding of the bureaucracy. One of the things that I would do within the first 100 days would be to convene an Oakland education summit. I would bring together teachers, principals, administrators, and community organizations and bring OUSD staff and our charter partners. Because I know that when parents choose schools, they don’t care what the governance format is; they don’t care if it’s a charter or a public school. Generally, they want to know, is this a safe space for my kid? Is it going to be academically enriching? Is this a place that is going to build social and emotional skills that are going to help them launch into the next part of their lives? We haven’t done that in quite a long time. Greg Hodge speaks to teachers and other community leaders at a press conference at OUSD’s downtown Oakland headquarters in December 2021, about the district’s budget shortfall and the future of OUSD. Way back when Elihu Harris was mayor, he did an education summit. It was over the course of a weekend: a Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday over at Mills College. They were good conversations because you can’t have those conversations at a board meeting. You can’t have those conversations at a City Council meeting. So I think the mayor, as the chief convener, ought to be able to pull that conversation together. And in preparation for that, we should do a couple of things: One, we should make sure that we have an equity analysis of the current conditions of our schools. Some of that work has been done, but I think the city’s department of equity could be helpful with that. To be able to say, when you get ready to close a school or you’re going to put more resources into a school, here’s why. Some of the groundwork for that has been laid with the reparations for Black students work that’s happening. I think that’s the first thing. Second, we need to do an independent financial audit of the school’s finances because it’s an issue of trust at this point. Personally, I think that the data that comes out of the school district staff is pretty good, compared to where it was years ago, but nobody trusts it. So I think you need to have either a city auditor, or maybe somebody from the state level, and I’m not talking about FCMAT (Fiscal Crisis and Management Assistance Team)—but some entity that people trust, to say, here are the resources we have and here’s the number of children we’re serving—right around 35,000. Here’s the number of school buildings—we have 85. Typically, other districts have about half of that. But how do we get to that? Because there’s one thing I know for sure: We fight to keep schools like Parker open, but there are a lot of schools that aren’t serving Black and brown kids well. So from an equity perspective, we have so much work to do. I think the mayor’s office can be the bully pulpit for how to make that work go. While I applaud Oakland Promise, Oakland Divided, and all of what Libby’s doing, she has never really jumped into the fray. And nobody wants to because it’s hard. But I think that that is the role of the mayor in the city, and it is a set of issues that people care about a lot. We know that Oakland’s roads, today and for generations, have been filled with potholes. They’re poorly designed and they lack crosswalks that are safe. There are not enough speed bumps, allowing cars to go super fast. There aren’t enough bike lanes. How will you improve these conditions in Oakland? And how will those changes be funded? We have resources currently for street repair. There’ll be a ballot measure, Measure U, that will provide some additional resources for streets if it passes. I think that it’s maybe an issue of transparency. If there was a way to let the average Oaklander know about the progress of street redesign and repairs including pothole remediation and crosswalks, you know—do an assessment so the public understands, here’s what we’ve been doing with your money over the last five or six years, and here’s what we’re planning to do. The budget, that’s where we need to be really clear. And this is where some of the debates about what we do with Howard Terminal matter. We’re getting up here now to a price tag upwards of $320 million for infrastructure alone, in and around Howard Terminal just to make that development go. A lot of people are still not happy. They’re not happy with their streets. And they’re saying, like, why aren’t we spending that kind of resource on filling potholes, creating more bike lanes, all of the things you described? I think that’s one part of it. In other words, make it more visible in terms of what we are doing and what we plan to do, and where the resources are coming from. The other thing I’d say, and it’s a drop in the bucket, but I think it has something to do with our overall civic morale: You have these pothole vigilantes, people who are going out in the middle of the night with bags of asphalt and a shovel and they’re filling up holes in their neighborhood and doing that work without any city participation. On one of the National Night Out events, I was over in the Fruitvale neighborhood and I noticed it looked like there were some potholes that had been filled. And there were some interesting, lateral speed bumps—they weren’t perpendicular across the roadway, they were in parallel. And I asked [a community member], “What’s that?” And he said, “Well, we just get a lot of people in cars doing doughnuts down here, and now we’re trying to keep people from doing that.” But there was some citizen engagement there. Years ago, I was in Toronto for a family vacation and saw a man in the morning, who was doing graffiti removal. And I went and asked him because he kind of looked like an official city person, but he was a neighbor who had been empowered by the city to actually do graffiti removal. The city gave him all the materials, the tools, the advice, and training about how to do it. It’s the kind of program that I think Oakland could use because we already see people every week doing street repairs and cleaning up illegal dumping. There is definitely an energy in Oakland to do some of that sort of self-help, self-directed work. But I think the city could be a much better partner with neighbors who are trying to do something on their block. What would you prioritize as mayor? Building new infrastructure for biking and walking? Or should we improve the roads for safer driving? I think it should be a balance between the two, to be honest. I’ll give you an example. I use my bike quite a bit and I can walk downtown, but I also drive. So as a driver, when all of those modifications happened to Telegraph Avenue between downtown and 40th Street, it was really confusing. As a bike rider, it felt more dangerous to have the bike lane next to the curb, to have parking, and then have people driving up the street. So part of it is like, where did we test these ideas? I’m sure that the Department of Transportation came up with this idea from something they saw in another city. But for me, as a driver, I was nervous about making a right turn because I could never see the bike riders. So it’s an example of a design flaw that we should be paying attention to. As we do this, I think the basic infrastructure has got to be improved so that your basic roadway is free of potholes. Every time I’m on any street in Oakland and it’s a new street, I just marvel at it. Because I haven’t seen a new street in my neighborhood since I’ve been here, and I’ve been in this house since 1992. The second thing I’d say is, I was talking to Creighton Davis, who is our coordinator for the neighborhood crime prevention councils. They’re trying to shift away from just talking about crime prevention, to being more like the organizers in neighborhoods. It would be really interesting to see those neighborhood prevention councils turn into neighborhood empowerment councils so that every neighborhood weighed in with the city government around: How do you see your neighborhood? What is your vision? Or if there is a conflicting vision about it, have some public process to come to some agreement or at least a compromise where you make sure that everybody who wants to be involved has had an opportunity to give their say. But then figure out what people really want in their neighborhood through decentralizing these decisions with the city government, because every neighborhood is a little bit different. Public safety is something a lot of our readers weighed in on and wanted us to ask the candidates. Oakland has 681 police officers right now. Is that too few or too many? And can you explain your thinking on the issue of police staffing in Oakland? Public safety is what I’m most interested in. And I think we always start with policing. And as part of the answer to a public safety question, I think what we need is a comprehensive approach to it that starts with prevention—all of the work I think I mentioned earlier in this around the Department of Violence Prevention, the kinds of things that DVP can be doing if we double, triple, quadruple the budget there. In terms of police, I think we need around 700 [officers]. I would add a few more because I want us to avoid spending so much on overtime. And as we do that, I want to see police officers with a much more focused approach to what law enforcement is going to do to focus on the most serious, violent incidents. And do what we’ve begun to do with MACRO, where we’re taking the nonviolent, non-emergency calls off of our 911 dispatch system. Start moving them to other non-sworn officers, non-sworn civilians who can respond to those. We have to get our investigatory capacity up—we’ve got to have a much better clearance rate than 40% [for homicides]. Washington DC solves about 80% of their murders. So [people are] out here doing dirt and nobody’s willing to be accountable, in part, because in Oakland you’ve got a six in 10 chance of not getting caught. You could shoot somebody in front of City Hall and maybe get away with it. So I think the investigatory piece is really important. Some of those roles on the forensics and the tech side of this don’t have to be sworn officers, either. So I think that the number of officers is vacillating right around 700, in part because Measure Z requires us to. And until we can go back to the voters, we have to have a minimum number of cops. But I think that the more we can do to take—as my friend David Muhammad calls it— the “cat in the tree” problems off of the officers to respond, I think you’re gonna get better response times, you’re going to have a more dedicated police force that really doesn’t feel like they’re doing all these other things. Because when a lot of these folks are hired, they really want to make communities safer. So law enforcement is what we do to people, and public safety is what we do with people. And that’s the mantra from me, and how we should be thinking about public safety. I think that beautification efforts also—really cracking down on illegal dumping. It’s my understanding that we lost four full-time city staff who were focused on illegal dumping. You know, you’ve got to have some staff that focuses on that. I put all of that in the same basket around public safety. It’s prevention, it’s law enforcement, and it has to do with the environment, and sending a message to our kids and our seniors about their safety. You mentioned having the police focus more solely on violent crime. Gun violence is probably the most serious issue in Oakland. What is your plan to prevent gun violence? We’ve got to do more of what we’ve started to do around “ghost guns”—getting unregistered, unmarked guns off the street. I don’t necessarily agree with gun buybacks. People will often talk about gun buyback as one method. One of the folks, several years ago when we were talking about gun buybacks in Oakland, said, “Look, I bring my gun, I get money, I go get a better gun.” So I mean, we’ve got to be more creative about how we think about getting guns off the street. Rob Bonta, our attorney general, just had a press conference in San Francisco about some new efforts from the state around gun violence reduction. And I think part of it is working with our state officials to figure out, how do we make gun charges stick? Our new district attorney, whoever that is going to be, whether it’s Pam Price or Terry Wiley, the DA has got a big role to play in terms of how we handle gun charges. But I also think there’s got to be a whole lot more work done in the community, by the community, along the lines of what I’ve talked about earlier—with folks who have been through the system, who know about incarceration, know the young people who are out here who are doing most of this dirt and figuring it out. Because really, there are about 200 families that are at the center of a lot of [the violence] that happens here. David Muhammad runs the National Center for Criminal Justice Reform. He and I have been friends for a long time and he’s one of my policy advisors around safety. And he talks about the fact that, at any given moment, there are 150 to 200 families whose kids—and these are young kids, 12, 13, 14 years old—who are out here doing some of the worst acts with the guns. We have to get to those young people. We have to interrupt that whole cycle. Just this last week, two people got killed in front of a mosque. Two people got killed in front of City Hall. A little girl got killed, I think in North Oakland. It’s almost like we’re numb at this point. We have to do something. We have to shake this up in a pretty significant way. Because most people in Oakland just don’t feel safe. The Ceasefire program that the city operates—do you more or less think that’s on the right path? Or do you think the city needs to do something different? I think you’ve got to do Ceasefire on steroids. The original Ceasefire program in Boston, 30 years ago, was a combination of, like, we’re going to work with you if you want to get out of his life that you’re in on the streets, but we’re also going to have law enforcement come down really hard if you don’t. It also was coupled with a job-training program so that young people would have an opportunity. Anybody who’s under 30 years old had an opportunity to get a job. And I think that part of what we haven’t done a good job of in Oakland, is we haven’t connected our workforce dollars to our violence prevention dollars in a good enough way. So with the Ceasefire model and the Department of Violence Prevention, again, if we were paying attention to what Richmond did, we would have structured the DVP differently. I got asked to give advice about it. Our City Council person, Lynette McElheney at the time, was trying to do the political thing of adding the kitchen sink—like we’re just going to put everything in here, including [homicide investigation] clearance rate—and it just doesn’t work. We need to really assess what DVP is doing up, down, and sideways. The community partners that have been working with them—like BOSS (Building Opportunities for Self Sufficiency) and Oakland Frontline Healers—we need to make sure that people are playing appropriate roles, but we have to bolster what they can do. Ceasefire has been tried in a lot of places and it works in varying degrees. But I think it works well when you’ve got that work component attached to it—work, and education. You have a wealth of experience in leadership roles with organizations focused on bettering the lives of people of color, especially men and boys of color. What would you bring from that experience to the role of mayor for a diverse, often polarized city that’s experienced a massive loss of residents of color, especially Black residents, for the past couple of decades? What I bring is a keen sense of public and community processes. Like, how do we get people to have hard conversations with each other? Years ago, I ran a conversation with 20 cops and 20 kids over an eight-week period, and we got to some understanding about the stereotypes that kids have about cops and vice versa. And it was in partnership with the chief of police at that time. So I think there’s something about my experience, working inside organizations as a facilitator, a meeting designer, and as somebody who gets people to have conversations. Number two, I’ve got 40 years of experience in Oakland. I’ve worked with various organizations from faith-based to arts to public policy. As an elected board member, I’ve done racial equity work around the country, from Buffalo to Miami to Little Rock to Chicago to Louisville. So I have a sense of what other people are doing in cities around the country. The third thing is kind of intangible: I still believe in us, I still believe in Oakland. I still believe we can be the city we want to become. I haven’t given up. I’ve got friends who have moved to other places, especially as I get closer to the purported retirement age, I’ve got friends who are leaving because they say I just don’t want to deal with it anymore. And I put myself out here as a candidate, because I think that we can still do great things in Oakland if we can work together. So the thing that distinguishes me from other candidates is that set of experiences and skill set, not just as somebody who was on a legislative body on a school board, but also as a manager, as somebody who has run nonprofit organizations. I was the first director of what’s now Oakland Thrives. I was the first director of the Freedom Schools program. I’ve worked with philanthropy, and I often don’t talk about that deep connection to philanthropy. And folks are waiting to help. They really want to help with the right civic leadership here in Oakland. Is there anything you’d like to discuss that we didn’t ask you? One thing you didn’t ask about is my relationship with the faith community, and how the faith community can be more active and engaged around the issues of healing here in Oakland. Because people are hurting. You know, a lot of people are doing fine, depending on where you live and how you move about in the city. But there are a lot of people who just aren’t feeling it. And I just think that that sense of hope, and how we feel—we’re not talking about it enough. That’s the intangible part that people are really kind of looking for. Before you go...

Smash-and-grab burglaries at businesses. Thousands of car thefts . Bomb threats and shootings at schools. A child in a stroller injured by bullet fragments . Oakland is experiencing a disturbing increase in violent crime right now. It’s mainly because of a spike in robberies, up 31% this year. Homicides also increased during the pandemic to levels that hadn’t been seen in over a decade. With 79 killings so far in 2023, it appears this disturbing trend isn’t ending anytime soon. Property crimes, especially car break-ins, are also way up right now, according to police data . Many Oaklanders are looking to city and county leaders to offer solutions for a safer city. Over the past few months, residents have been able to hear from elected officials and offer feedback at meetings organized by neighborhood groups , small business owners , and city council members . Perhaps the biggest community meeting yet about public safety this year is happening on Saturday at an East Oakland church. In attendance will be the city and county’s top law enforcement officials, including District Attorney Pamela Price, as well as Mayor Sheng Thao and District 6 Councilmember Kevin Jenkins. They’ll discuss crime, illegal dumping, abandoned vehicles, and more. If you’ve heard about Saturday’s town hall with the mayor and DA, you may have also heard that there’s another event—a sort of counter protest—scheduled to happen outside the church and just before the town hall. This rally is being organized by a group called Neighbors Together Oakland and will feature former city councilmember Loren Taylor, among other speakers. The founder of Neighbors Together and the main organizer behind this rally, Seneca Scott, has a history of making inflammatory and false statements in public. Most recently, Scott took to Twitter to accuse Brandon Harami, a member of Mayor Thao’s staff and an out gay man, of being a pedophile without offering any evidence as to his claim. “I’m extremely hurt and disappointed to see the comments he made,” Harami told The Oaklandside today. Multiple East Bay political organizations, including the East Bay Stonewall Democratic Club, a 40-year-old group that advocates for LGBTQ+ rights, have strongly condemned Scott’s statement. “We urge community leaders (especially those who claim to support the LGBTQ+ community) to stand against hate and avoid giving a platform to those who repeatedly spread anti-LGBTQ messages like Seneca Scott,” the East Bay Stonewall Democratic Club said in a statement on August 31. “The Alameda County Democratic Party condemns the comments made by Seneca Scott to the fullest extent and ask that all Democrats in Alameda County refuse to organize with him or participate in his events,” the county party said in a statement on September 7. The statement also noted that accusing gay men of being pedophiles is an old trope that’s been used to attack the LGBTQ community many times in the past, and that this kind of hate speech is again on the rise. Cat Brooks, a prominent Oakland-based activist on issues of social justice and police brutality who Scott frequently criticizes on Twitter, said in an interview that she thinks Neighbors Together Oakland’s messaging about public safety in Oakland probably appeals to many Oaklanders who have never heard of its founder or have never encountered his online rhetoric. “I think a lot of the people putting up Neighbors Together lawn signs in their neighborhoods aren’t on Twitter,” she said. Not everyone agrees about how to make Oakland safer. Disagreement is inevitable and healthy. But local debate about how to make Oakland safer is no longer just passionate and contentious—it’s becoming increasingly hostile, featuring ad hominem attacks, name-calling, and even homophobic slurs and baseless accusations lobbed at city officials. Scott is at the center of this shift in tone in Oakland’s politics. Given the importance of a robust debate around public safety, The Oaklandside took a close look at the two upcoming events, asking some of the organizers and attendees about their views regarding safety, and about recent controversial statements by the main organizer of Saturday’s competing event. The mayor and the DA will speak on their recent actions—and the criticism they’ve gotten—on public safety Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao at a recent press conference discussing public safety problems. Credit: Amir Aziz The town hall on Saturday will be hosted by Bishop George Matthews at Genesis Worship at noon. Guest speakers scheduled to appear include District Attorney Pamela Price, Acting Oakland Police Chief Darren Allison, Mayor Sheng Thao, Councilmember Kevin Jenkins, Sheriff Yesenia Sanchez, Alameda County Supervisor Nate Miley, and Alameda County Probation Chief Marcus Dawal. This is the third year Matthews has organized a community event to address public safety issues. Leigh Hanson, Mayor Thao’s chief of staff, said each speaker will describe their role in local government and their priorities. They will also answer questions that attendees can submit in advance on comment cards to Matthews, who will be moderating the event. According to a flier for the event, officials will discuss illegal dumping, abandoned vehicles, car window break-ins, and other public safety issues. Thao has faced criticism from some constituents for her decision in February to fire Chief LeRonne Armstrong after outside investigators found Armstrong was derelict in his duty to properly discipline a police sergeant who committed a hit-and-run and later shot his gun inside police headquarters and tried to cover up the shooting. The Oakland chapter of the NAACP has said that Armstrong’s firing was unwarranted and has played a role in the increase in violence. “We mourn the injudicious removal of the person who was truly making a difference in restoring the faith of the community in the OPD,” the group wrote in a June press release. Earlier this week, Thao highlighted some of her administration’s public safety policies . For example, Governor Gavin Newsom recently agreed to send Oakland additional California Highway Patrol officers to assist with traffic enforcement in high-injury corridors. The city also received a $1.2 million loan to pay for more automated license plate readers . (The city currently has about 30 of these surveillance cameras, but police haven’t used them for months.) Thao has also initiated an audit of the Ceasefire program, the city’s main gun-violence-reduction strategy, which was disrupted by the pandemic . The mayor said she’s also more than doubled the city’s investment in the Mobile Assistance Community Responders of Oakland ( MACRO ) program, which sends civilians to deal with non-violent and non-emergency calls. Thao and the City Council also agreed to spend $1 million per year for civilian safety ambassadors to deter crime in business corridors as part of the new biennial budget. Thao preserved most of the funding for the Department of Violence Prevention , which uses life coaches and other civilian contractors to disrupt cycles of violence. “I’m very interested to hear from the community around real solutions and around real ways we can work together in partnership to create a safer Oakland,” Thao told The Oaklandside. District Attorney Pamela Price is responsible for prosecuting crimes that occur in Alameda County. Price was elected last year on a progressive platform of reforming the criminal justice system and prosecuting police for misconduct, in addition to advocating for victims of crime. In recent months, Price has become the focal point for community anger over the spike in violent crime. Some in the community disagree with Price’s policies to not use enhancements in many cases—special extra charges that can add additional prison time to sentences if a person is found guilty—and not to charge juveniles as adults, among other reforms. Several community leaders recently filed paperwork to start a recall campaign against Price. Earlier this week, paperwork was filed to oppose the recall. During a July town hall meeting in Montclair , several residents demanded that Price crack down on criminal offenders with harsher punishments. Price explained her belief that systemic change is needed to address the root causes of crime. Price’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. What’s happening at the Neighbors Together rally? Neighbors Together Oakland is hosting a rally on Saturday from 10 to 11:30 a.m. on Hillside Street between Ritchie Street and 80th Avenue. This is next to the Genesis Worship Center. According to the poster for the event and an interview with one of the organizers, the rally is scheduled to include as guest speakers: Former Oakland Councilmember Loren Taylor Mary Theroux, board chair and CEO of the Independent Institute , an East Bay think tank, who will talk about policies for addressing homelessness Jazmin Villalta, the co-founder of Cocina Del Corazon , who will be speaking about Oakland food deserts Tanya Boyce, executive director of the Environmental Democracy Project , who will discuss urban blight and environmental destruction and inequity A student at McClymonds High School who will address a large brawl that happened recently at Emeryville Station According to organizers with Neighbors Together , California State Assemblymember Mia Bonta, Oakland Councilmember Kevin Jenkins, and Alameda County Supervisor Nate Miley have also said they will attend the rally. Neighbors Together Oakland (NTO) is a nonprofit organization founded in 2021 by Seneca Scott . We’ve asked an NTO representative about the size of the organization’s membership and whether anyone in the group is paid for their work, and will update the story if we receive a response. Scott is the former East Bay director for SEIU Local 1021 and the co-founder of the entertainment company Oakhella and the Bottoms Up Community Garden. Last September, while Scott was running for Oakland mayor, OakHella’s other co-founders distanced themselves from Scott following the circulation of a photo showing him wearing a sandwich board with an anti-trans message on it and standing next to a well-known anti-trans activist. Scott received 3% of the first-round vote in the mayor’s race , coming in seventh place among 10 candidates. He unsuccessfully ran for the Oakland City Council District 3 seat in 2020. We requested an interview with Scott for this story. Tim Gardner, a board member of Neighbors Together Oakland, told us that Scott was unavailable and offered to speak to us as a representative of NTO. Gardner said the purpose of Saturday’s event is to bring community members together to promote public safety solutions. “The city is in an unprecedented downward spiral,” he said, citing the number of homicides and an uptick in other violent crimes, as well as severe homelessness. Gardner said that crime has been “horrible” for each of the past 15 years he’s lived in Oakland. Violent crime has increased over the past three years, but it is not at unprecedented levels. The violent crime rate was higher in 2012, according to an analysis by the San Francisco Chronicle . The city’s violent crime was also higher in the mid-2000s and in the early and mid-1990s. Gardner said local leaders, including the mayor and the City Council, are not doing enough to combat crime. He raised concerns about the size of the police department and the city’s failure to use its automated license plate reader system . Gardner said the mayor should declare a state of emergency, followed by a request for every city department to submit a list of ideas for solving the public safety crisis. He also said the mayor should hold multiple fireside chats each month to inform the public. Gardner crowdsourced ideas recently in a public document that he said was presented to the staff of California State Assemblymember Mia Bonta, whose district includes Oakland and Alameda. The ideas include deploying state law enforcement officers or the national guard to Oakland, fixing 911 response times, restoring police chief LeRonne Armstrong, and revoking Oakland’s ban on high-speed police chases. “They’re not all good, but a lot of them are good,” Gardner said of the list. “When 79 people have died already this year, there’s no reason we shouldn’t be doing everything in our power to address this crisis.” Loren Taylor, who ran against Thao last year, said the mayor hasn’t shown sufficient urgency in her response to violent crimes in Oakland. He believes Oakland should declare a local state of emergency to obtain additional resources and strip away bureaucratic barriers that he claims prevent the city from adequately dealing with the public safety crisis. “I’m attending the event and accepted the invitation because the focus is on solutions that are actionable and that we can hold each other accountable to,” Taylor said, adding that specific requests will be presented to elected officials participating in the nearby town hall. According to Gardner, Taylor will be introducing a resolution on public safety for the city council to take up. Thao told The Oaklandside public safety is her number one priority. She also disagreed about the need for implementing a local state of emergency, noting that her administration is already able to get additional resources from outside Oakland, noting by way of example the extra CHP officers and funding for ALPR cameras that Oakland received from the state. “To say there’s no urgency on our part is just politicizing this issue,” Thao said. “Of course there’s urgency.” On Tuesday, the Oakland branch of the NAACP—of which Scott is an executive member along with Taylor—released a list of goals to achieve a safer city. The group wants to improve the 911 call system and increase OPD to a minimum of 1,000 officers. The department is currently budgeted for over 700 officers, but due to personnel on long-term leave, it is hovering under 650. The NAACP didn’t say how they would pay for an extra 300 or so officers, which would probably cost the city upwards of $80 million . The NAACP also wants the city to install more security cameras and license plate readers, secure ongoing support from CHP to patrol Oakland’s highways, and enact programs that give youth economic alternatives to crime. From homophobic statements to calls for martial law, Scott’s online rhetoric has been harshly rebuked The Neighbors Together rally on Saturday is being billed as an event to promote “solidarity and solutions,” but over the past week, some East Bay civic groups have called out homophobic statements made by Scott over social media, calling them divisive and hateful. On August 27, Scott tweeted that “@MayorShengThao staffer Brandon Harami is a proud supporter of the MAP (minor attracted person) movement. Now just let that sink in. Is this why he has such intense Daddies issues? Usually people who were touched are the ones that touch others. Very alarming.” On August 31, the East Bay Stonewall Democratic Club, one of the Bay Area’s oldest and largest LGBTQ+ political organizations, issued a statement saying it “strongly condemns the hateful anti-LGBTQ statements from former Oakland candidate Seneca Scott.” The group urged community leaders to “avoid giving a platform to those who spread such messages.” On September 6, the Alameda County Democratic Party issued a statement saying it refuses to organize with Scott or participate in his events due to comments he’s made. The statement says that Scott “continues to spread false and dangerous narratives about LGBTQ+ individuals, even falsely accusing former CADEM Progressive Caucus Vice Chair and current Mayoral Staffer Brandon Harami of homophobic tropes.” Scott declined an interview request, stating that he won’t speak to our newsroom until Oaklandside news editor Darwin BondGraham is fired for allegedly “attempting to intimidate a whistleblower” and for exhibiting a “disturbing pattern of selective aggression towards people of color he doesn’t agree with politically.” [Editor’s note: The Oaklandside stands behind BondGraham and rejects Scott’s claims.] The Oaklandside sent Scott a follow-up email asking for a response to the Alameda County Democratic Party’s statement and for evidence to back up his claim about Harami. Scott did not address these questions. He instead responded with a link to a YouTube video, posted last year by an account with two followers and no other content, that accused Harami of secretly running a Twitter account that disparaged other candidates in last year’s Oakland mayoral race. Hours later, Scott released a statement on Twitter saying he stands in solidarity with LGBTQIA+ allies. He encouraged any individuals offended by his actions to contact him directly. “I will be open minded in addressing their concerns about my character and what I truly believe, which is that I support LGBTQIA+ rights,” Scott said. Scott claims that the resolutions condemning his statements are part of a “highly-coordinated smear campaign” to retaliate against him and his group. He accused Mayor Sheng Thao and Brandon Harami of placing pressure on the two political clubs to issue statements condemning him. After Scott released his statement, Matt Lardner from The East Bay Stonewall Democratic Club told The Oaklandside that his group was not pressured to release a statement. “We felt called to respond to anti-LGBTQ comments recently made by Mr. Scott,” Lardner said in an email. Scott has a history of accusing people on Twitter of being pedophiles. In July he accused someone of being a pedophile for supporting the flying of a Pride flag on a Southern California city’s municipal building. In response to a misleading report about medical school curriculum, he tweeted that Harvard University Medical School has “big pedo energy.” In March, Scott replied to a tweet thread that accused Joe Biden of molesting children, saying Biden had “pedo ways.” Harami told The Oaklanside that he’s trying to stay focused on his work as the city’s director of community resilience. He said Scott’s statement isn’t just hurtful to him personally; it also has him worried for the safety of Oakland residents. “Right-wing people come to Oakland to try to combat ‘wokeness and progressiveness’ with violence. When Seneca goes on Fox news and speaks about this nationally it’s inviting more of that hate and bigotry into our city.” Harami added that he doesn’t understand why some influential people and groups in Oakland appear to be unwilling to condemn Scott’s homophobic attack against him. On social media, especially Twitter, Scott’s messages often are widely shared. In a September 4 Twitter post, he wrote that Oakland needs “ soft martial law ” to address its public safety problems. He didn’t clarify what he meant, but martial law involves the suspension of democratic institutions and the replacement of civilian leaders with the military and police. Prominent Oakland officials share why they are, or aren’t, attending Scott’s rally When asked about attending the Neighbors Together rally after learning of Scott’s statements about Harami on Twitter, Loren Taylor told us that he’s not attending the event for Scott or any individual, but to help the community find solutions for public safety problems. “To me, this attempt to make an event about Seneca is an attempt to avoid responsibility for the issues that are not being addressed,” Taylor said. “We’ve got to focus on the issues.” Alameda County Supervisor Nate Miley told The Oaklandside he will try to attend the Neighbors Together Oakland rally before the town hall at Genesis Worship. Miley said he was not aware of Seneca’s comments or the resolutions condemning them. “I know Seneca is very controversial and he has his opinions,” Miley said. He added that no one should be discriminated against based on race, religion, or sexuality. District 6 City Councilmember Kevin Jenkins’ chief of staff, Patricia Brooks, said Jenkins won’t be able to attend the Neighbors Together Oakland rally because of a scheduling mixup, although she or another staffer may be there. Assemblymember Mia Bonta’s office did not respond to an interview request. Tim Gardner of Neighbors Together Oakland tweeted on August 23 that Bonta would be a guest at the event. On September 6, Bonta tweeted that she is not speaking at the event, nor is anyone from her office. Gardner referred to the resolutions condemning Scott as “political mudslinging” and said the accusations aren’t based on evidence. “If they want to talk in person and discuss these issues and show the basis of these grievances, then we would be happy to do that,” Gardner said. Vincent Ray Williams III, another prominent local activist and founder of the Urban Compassion Project , which conducts cleanups and helps homeless residents get food and other resources, said he had to cancel his appearance at the Neighbors Together rally because he has a clean-up event to attend at the same time. Williams, who is queer, said his decision has nothing to do with negative comments made about Scott, noting that he’s witnessed Scott support members of the LGBTQ+ community. “I got to see this man on a different plane than what most people get to see,” Williams said. Mayor Thao told The Oaklandside that she thinks the promotion of hateful and bigoted speech or attacks against her staff or anyone else has no place in Oakland. “This is not just an attack against my personal staff,” Thao said. “This is an attack against the LGBTQ+ community.” Before you go...

We amplify community voices, share the power of real information, and investigate systems, not just symptoms. Donate We’ve invited nine of the 10 people running to be the next mayor of Oakland to sit down with us for in-depth interviews, asking them mostly the same questions. Such as, how many police officers does the Oakland Police Department need? How would they help the City Council and the city administration work together better? How would they fix Oakland’s potholes? We developed these questions with help from hundreds of Oakland residents who answered our election survey this summer; thank you to everyone who weighed in. Oakland mayoral candidate interviews Greg Hodge Seneca Scott Loren Taylor Ignacio De La Fuente Sheng Thao Treva Reid Allyssa Victory John Reimann Tyron Jordan Settle in for a long read; these conversations are weighty, befitting the office these candidates seek. They’ve been edited for length, relevance, and clarity, with some added fact-checking and background reading from us. (And note that we decided not to interview candidate Peter Liu and provide another platform for his dangerous and hateful rhetoric. ) This interview is with John Reimann, a retired carpenter and former recording secretary of the Carpenters Local 713. Reimann is a socialist who believes that meaningful change—in Oakland, and elsewhere—will only come about from a working-class social movement that’s built from the ground up. In recent years there have been several examples of tension between the City Council and the city administrator. Oftentimes the City Council doesn’t feel like the city administrator is enacting the policies and laws that they’ve approved. On the other hand, the city administration often feels like City Council is overstepping or loading up its plate with too much work, things like that. If you were elected mayor, how would you repair this relationship? Well, I have a different view of the city administrator and that whole role. I think that oftentimes we see appointed administrators like that from the city level all the way up to the federal level, we see them as playing the role of dodging popular discontent around certain decisions. And so I do believe that it’s elected officials who should run the city from start to finish. Of course, the question is, how do those officials get elected? And on what basis? The fact of the matter is that here in Oakland, the elected officials—if you look at campaign donations—you can see they’re basically run by the real-estate developers. So the whole method of running the City Council and administering the city has to be transformed. Regarding the last budget that was written by the mayor and approved b the City Council with amendments, was there anything in it that you objected to, that you would have cut as mayor? And anything left out that you feel should have been included? Number one, we should start taxing the Port of Oakland. If I’m not mistaken, the Port of Oakland is the only port on the West Coast, or at least in California, that is not being taxed. That is a huge potential source of revenue. Also, you cannot solve all the budgetary problems for the city without transforming the whole tax structure in the state with both corporate taxes and property taxes on the wealthy. In order to transform that, that’s not going to come from the top. It needs a movement from below. To put it quite bluntly, a working-class movement, to force those changes. Because, over the years, we’ve seen that the tax structure has been changed to benefit the rich and the corporations. That tax structure has been changed by Republicans and Democrats alike. It’s definitely true that the tax structure is more regressive now than it has been at the federal level, and for some local taxes. But again, looking at the city of Oakland’s budget and putting aside those bigger changes—was there anything specifically left out or not included in the last budget that you would have fought to include or remove? I think there should be a massive transfer and also an addition of money put into locally and democratically elected committees of public safety, to by and large replace the role of the police in communities. Just for example, in my neighborhood—I have lived for many years in the neighborhood that used to be known as Funktown—I’ve seen different instances of violence out in the streets: people getting into fights, situations where some man might be beating up a woman. And in general, I would not call the police on that because someone can end up getting killed. So if we had genuine community-run and community-elected committees of public safety, that would be the alternative for things like that. Oakland is thousands of units short of meeting the affordable housing goals that are set by the region and state, the so-called RHNA goals. Would expanding affordable housing in Oakland be a goal of yours as mayor? If so, what concrete steps would you take to do that? And how would market-rate development or social housing fit into this plan? First of all, we should understand that what they call affordable housing is largely a fraud—because what it’s based on is the rent that is affordable to the average income in whatever area we’re talking about. But what we see in many parts of Oakland, including my own neighborhood, is gentrification [causing] average incomes to go up. So what was affordable yesterday for an average working-class person—let’s say a single mom who is working maybe 50 hours a week just to support her kids—what was affordable to her yesterday is not longer affordable because the average income has gone up. So of course, I support affordable housing. But as I said, it’s largely a fraud. Is there something the mayor could do? Do you think it’s the role of the mayor to restructure the system of eligibility then, for affordable housing? Or given those constraints, what would your plan be? Well, here we get into what’s the fundamental difference between myself and every single other candidate. I’m not the “vote for me and I’ll set you free” candidate. All of history shows that the only real changes that we’ve seen in this country have come about from a movement from below—not from some great mayor or senator or president producing those changes. I came up during the Civil Rights era, and that’s living proof. Same with the labor movement in the 1930s. So that’s a long way of saying that it’s not a matter of the role of the mayor, per se, but as a mayor or even a candidate for mayor, encouraging and helping to organize that movement from below that would demand and force into existence massive funding for publicly run housing, publicly owned and run housing. Because the whole housing-for-profit model has been just as much of a disastrous failure for people as healthcare-for-profit has been. Within that ground-up framework, are there specific programs and policies you would support or movements you would encourage around getting the 5,000 unhoused people in Oakland off the street? And how would you balance pressing safety concerns like fires at homeless camps with the pleas from many in the community to not criminalize the people living out there, who are trying to survive? You know, I’ve been at various different protests against rousting people from homeless encampments, most recently down there at Wood Street. I don’t believe in simply rousting people from what amounts to their home—we call them “homeless” but those are the only homes people know. Yet I also understand that there are a lot of problems around those homeless camps. I often think that if I was living in the streets like that, I might be causing a lot of those problems, because the mere fact of having to live in the street like that plays a massive role in destabilizing people. So we need to provide housing, through public-owned housing. And in the meantime, we need massive funding for services for people that are living in those encampments. You need social and psychological services and all of that, but also you need sanitation services. There’s a big homeless encampment not far from where I live and I see mounds of garbage out there in the streets. Why? Because there’s no place for people to leave their garbage. So sanitation, providing bathrooms and washing-up facilities, and also cooking facilities, we need all of that. We need funding for all of that, and that gets back of course to the issue of the budget, which I was talking about earlier. So your focus would be more on cleaning and supporting and stabilizing the conditions at those camps versus making people leave? Right. And again, we have to understand that no mayor can bring that about by himself or herself. It needs that movement from below to demand these things. One big challenge business owners are dealing with is the rising cost of goods due to global supply-chain issues. Have you thought about any local solutions to this national problem? A central, fundamental reason why I’m running for office is to try to clarify the fact that there are no local solutions. Or, put it this way: The local problems are just an expression of national and, in fact, international crises. What you’re really referring to as I understand your question is inflation. One fundamental part of inflation is the massive increase in oil prices. Well, that’s an international issue. Even at the national level, the president cannot affect that. So to put it more clearly, what you’re really talking about is an economic crisis of capitalism itself. So, once again, we need a movement from below to transform the entire system. There are some local issues and local means of helping to alleviate these problems. For instance, you have the issue of rents. You also have the issue of costs—of getting capital for small businesses. Those things, to a certain extent at the city level, you can deal with that. But you need a budget that enables the city to deal with those issues and for that, again, we get back to that question that I’m talking about. You need a movement from below. And as we’ve seen, here in Oakland, it’s the real-estate interests that control the Democratic Party, so there are not going to be any means of resolving those problems. Residents we’ve surveyed have noted the lack of large grocery stores and fresh produce in Oakland, particularly in West and East Oakland. How will you work with councilmembers in those areas to create more grocery stores with better, healthier options? When I was a kid growing up in New York City on the Lower East Side, we had a huge, city-run market—it was like a crazy grocery store—where different local vendors had little fruit stands, there was a butcher, and so on. I remember going down there with my sister and my mother once a week and she would do the shopping. We need things like that here in Oakland. If you had extremely low rents or possibly no rents at all, then those small fruit stands and so on would be more than competitive with the giant food chains. That’s what I would like to see. Take, for instance, the old, long-vacant Oakland arena there at Lake Merritt—that would be one potential place. And there are all kinds of vacant lots and buildings throughout the city where city-run [grocery] centers like that could be set up. Both the Oakland Coliseum and Arena are huge entertainment hubs. Whether the A’s leave and move to Howard Terminal or leave Oakland altogether, what do you envision for the future of that site? Those sites could be, number one, shopping centers in the way that I’ve pictured them. You’d also obviously have to have public transit to make those arenas easily accessible to people. And also they could be centers for the arts. I would not support simply having them be new sources for luxury housing and expensive condos and hotels and so on. Also, by the way, we should remember that there was a proposal for a gambling site not far from the airport and we should be on the lookout for something like that again in the future. It’s a horrible idea. I mean, you could build concentration camps that would bring tax revenue to the city. But in the first place, it’s been proven that all forms of gambling like that are essentially a tax on the poor and workers. So it’s a very regressive form of taxation. And are we going to say anything that brings tax revenue to the city are things that we support? People should be on the lookout so we can stop it dead in its tracks [if it ever again gets proposed]. Oakland spends a few million dollars per year on arts and culture through its city budget. Should the city be funding the arts directly or are there bigger priorities? Oh yeah, of course, we should be supporting it directly. Of course. Both in terms of providing residencies and artists’ studios and providing public entertainment where different musicians and entertainers can perform, and not just expect them to perform for free. Baseball players don’t perform for free. So why should artists, who really add some cultural value, have to? And I’m not talking about just once a month at First Fridays, but regular sources [of entertainment] in city parks, or close down a city street in different neighborhoods, and so on. Public schools in Oakland are run by Oakland Unified and various charter management organizations, but Mayor Libby Schaaf has always made education a priority, with programs like Oakland Undivided, Oakland Promise, and the Oakland teacher residency program. What role do you think the mayor should play in Oakland’s public education issues? First of all, I should make it clear that I’m no Johnny-come-lately to this. I’ve been involved in the protests against the closing of Oakland public schools, which is the other side of the coin of the privatization of public schools. I’m totally against closing public schools. They say, “Well we have to close this school because the enrollment has gone down.” Well, nine times out of 10 that’s [a school] in an area of tremendous economic and educational disadvantage. My view is that what we should fight for is, if the enrollment has gone down, then good! Then let’s have smaller class sizes. That’s what I would encourage us to demand of the board of education, which as I understand it there are a number of members of the board of education who are in favor of privatizing. I don’t know Libby Schaaf’s position on it, but I know from other things that she’s certainly helped grease the wheels for that. So as mayor you would use your position to push for the district to stop closing schools? That would be one thing, yes. And you know, I hope this isn’t going too far afield, but I remember back in the 1960s, in the days of the Civil Rights Movement, I was going to a study group of high school students in Harlem who were studying history and current affairs. They were inspired to do that just by the movement itself. So we see how any struggle to really change society, inspires people, especially the youth, to learn. We have to have a curriculum that would provide the knowledge and inspiration for our young people to move in that direction. So that would be an important part of my program in regard to education, getting the youth themselves involved in developing that curriculum. The roads in Oakland are not in great shape, and our city experiences a higher number of serious collisions than most. What would you do to improve conditions in our city for pedestrians, bicyclists, and vehicles? We have to, in the first place, improve the roads. In my neighborhood, I know people who’ve had to have their cars realigned from hitting a pothole and have had flat tires. So we need to spend the money on that. We also need to spend money on mass public transit. I believe that it should be free and so those are a couple of specific things. And within that context, I think we also need to improve the bike lanes and expand that even further. If you had a really true mass-transit system, then the use of private automobiles would vastly decline. The city itself doesn’t currently operate a transit system—that responsibility rests with the electeds governing Alameda County Transit and BART. Do you feel that the mayor could still play a role in expanding public transit? If so, how? Well again, none of these things is going to be done by executive fiat from above. We have to remember that the city and this whole area had the old Key System after World War II. What happened? General Motors bought it up and shut it down. So we see the influence of private manufacturers on civic policy. I’m sorry if I sound like a broken record, but again, it takes a movement from below of the organized working class and through their own political party to transform this. The mayor can help develop that and help make sure that there’s money that goes from the city to help finance a public transit system. You mentioned you want more bike lanes. What do you say to residents in Oakland, and there are plenty of them, who believe there are already too many bike lanes and the roads should be reconstructed and redesigned to simply improve the street conditions for driving and not for biking? I think we need both. And as I said, if public transit was more convenient and also free, then it would not be so difficult to have to maneuver your way around the bike lanes. I use a bike sometimes, but at my age, I can’t do it very much. So I think you need both. And we cannot allow ourselves to get into this battle between different interests that are really one and the same, that serve the same community of people. Do you have a sense of what the most dangerous roads in Oakland are? Based on your experience, what do you see as the priority roads that need to be fixed, in terms of safety? In my immediate neighborhood, E.18th Street is a real problem. 14th Avenue is a real problem. And even on my immediate streets, E. 22nd Street, E. 24th, people go whizzing up and down them like they’re on their way to a fire. None of these things are just technical problems. It gets into a whole issue of the mass psychology of millions of people, including tens of thousands here in Oakland, which hinges on the question of traffic safety also. You’ve said that you wouldn’t be a mayor who does things by fiat. But the mayor does have a lot of executive power—they get to write the budget, and direct spending and staff through the administrator to enact policies that could make real changes in people’s lives. Since your focus seems to be more on movement-building, why run for mayor? Well in the first place the mayor can’t just establish a budget by fiat. They have to get the City Council to approve it. Then you’re talking about a whole other layer of city government. And let’s not close our eyes to what’s happening at the national level where from 2016 to 2020 you had a president that created a national movement. Of course, it was a racist and entirely reactionary national movement, but it had a huge impact on all levels, in the United States and globally, including here in the city of Oakland. As I said, I’m not the “vote for me and I’ll set you free” candidate. If you don’t speak to that issue of political movements and the needs and interests and degree to which the working class is organized, if you don’t speak to that issue and make yourself perfectly clear on that—and I don’t mean you, personally, but if any candidate doesn’t—then what they are really doing is accepting the status quo. On the issue of public safety, Oakland has about 681 police officers right now. Do you feel that is too few, or too many? What’s your view on police staffing? I think the cops in Oakland are vastly overpaid. I forget the exact figures, but they are making way more than they should be. In any case, you can’t deal with that issue in isolation. I know the issue of crime and public safety is a huge issue for a lot of people. If you just say “Oh, we need more cops,” or “Oh, we need fewer cops,” in and of itself that leaves a lot of things unsaid. Those candidates who say we need more cops, they’re really heading in the direction of making Oakland a fortress with a cop on every corner. Also what they’re leaving unsaid—let’s not forget this—is that several studies have shown that fascist groups like the Proud Boys and others have massive numbers of police in them. These are racist, fascist groups. Incidentally, I don’t use that term freely—I never used to talk in those terms. But that’s the fact today. And I think it’s absolutely guaranteed that there are members of OPD that are involved in those groups, or at least sympathetic to those attitudes. So when you say that we need more cops, you’re covering over that aspect of what policing means. And when you say we need fewer cops, period, and just leave it at that, then you are ignoring the very real problems that we face, that ordinary working-class people such as myself face here in Oakland. So you have to bring into the equation the question of: How do we provide public safety for people? What I’m saying is we need publicly funded and democratically elected committees of public safety that will replace the police in the different communities. That’s the only way you can really answer that question, in a balanced way. Can you tell us more about what these public safety committees would look like, using the example of gun violence? As you know, many of the murders that happen in Oakland never get solved, and gun violence is a huge problem in the community. A partial example of what it looks like is the old Black Panther Party. You know, again, gun violence is not an issue that exists in isolation. I just barely missed, by a matter of a few minutes, a shooting here around the block from me. I’d just gotten inside my house. I could have easily been in that crossfire. Here’s another example of what it could look like: Years ago, there were a couple of young guys walking down the street. This is when Funktown was an active gang area. They’re walking down the street with rifles, and one of them pointed his rifle at my head and said, “What the hell are you looking at? I’ll blow your mother****ing brains out!” Now, the other guy that was with him, I used to be out in the street playing basketball with him, and he said, “Hey, leave youngblood alone, he’s cool.” So that’s a small individual example, of how a lot of this violence can be diffused. If you are known in the community, if you had a committee like that, that was known as, “These are people that are cool,” that’s a way to diffuse a lot of this gun violence. The alternative is to have a cop on every corner and have the cops shoot anybody that might possibly be carrying a gun. In other words, fortress Oakland. The Funtown gang—you’re talking about Harvey Whisenton . That was a long time ago. Yeah, it was. I’ve been living in this neighborhood since the 1970s. My corner used to be their place of business. It still feels a little bit fuzzy, in terms of how you’d go about trying to reduce gun violence. You’re saying that if there are people in the community, if they know each other better, maybe these things can be… No, no, no, that’s not what I’m saying—it’s not just having a nice feeling and kumbaya and all that stuff. I’m saying you have elected committees that are composed of and have direct roots in the community itself. And the people in those committees would patrol and walk the streets 24/7 and be on call to defuse these situations. I do think that with a lot of instances of violence, people really can be talked down. In fact, I’ve done that myself in other instances as well. If you’re known and people trust you, you really can talk people down. What are your thoughts about the Department of Violence Prevention? It’s a new department. Have you been following that work, and does it get at the direction you’re talking about? I have neighbors talk all the time about the dangers of violence and that sort of thing. I’ve never heard any of them talk about the Department of Violence Prevention. And I’ve read a little bit about it, but again, this is not going to be resolved by executive fiat or by something from on high. If you have a movement from below and out of that you have elected committees, that’s how it’s going to be solved. The Department of Violence Prevention, you know, it’s probably better than having a cop on every corner with a pistol on one hip and taser on the other and a billy club in his hand—I’m sure it’s better than that—but from what I see, it’s not present in the lives of my neighbors.

Tell us about yourself.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tGod tasked Peter Yuan Liu to bring world peace in 2003 at Ziggurat of Ur, Iraq. Self-made multimillionaire, 100% service-connected Army combat veteran, on mission to create United States University Online run by U.S. Dept. of Education, Bachelors degree level for $400, Masters for $600 and Doctorates for $800. Once mastering the subjects, apply to $500 Doctorate level testing that if passed with 70%+ gets Bachelors Degree with a license to practice in their trade, 85%+ for Masters, 95%+ Doctorate. University available worldwide, profits distributed back to the taxpayers as dividends, etc. All H1B VISA seekers must pass the exam, eliminating fake diploma mills, provide degree pathway using work experience/training and/or if college/university went bankrupt and/or lost accreditation. Liu, federally recognized journalist by the DINFOS, deemed too honest, blacklisted by Twitter, Facebook and #fakenews mass media even though he ranked 10th out of 27 candidates in the 2018 California gubernatorial primary with zero monetary contributions. Liu's Community Empowered Safety Plan brings peace and #CESP5 riches to his followers worldwide, making Ivy League Universities such as Harvard, Yale, like 56K modems in age of wireless 5G.

For every person caught with an illegal gun (stolen, serial scratched off, ineligible felon, etc.) obtain search warrants ASAP for their residences to get more illegal guns, find fingerprints on those guns, match in FBI databases for suspect straw purchasers for more potential arrests.\n3. Install mandatory surveillance in medium and high crime areas. Surveillance footage will be accessible real time via internet to lawful city residents with login and password.\n4. New policing strategy involve more community participation. Each officer will setup and advise a neighborhood watch that has about 7 to 25 volunteer members led by a team leader voted by the members. They will meet once a month to discuss issues affecting the neighborhood and the officer will be present as needed to give advice. Once the city declares an emergency, all neighborhood volunteers will be notified to prepare for best course of action to protect themselves or neighborhood which includes evacuation orders.\n5. Start a business center to teach small businesses entrepreneurship to city residents.

Donate Everything you need to know: A guide to Oakland’s Nov. 8 general election A candidate for Oakland mayor has been widely condemned for making antisemitic comments in mass emails first sent on Sunday. A fellow candidate has been criticized for his initial response to those comments. On Sunday, Peter Liu, who has twice run for Oakland mayor and never gotten more than 1% of the vote, sent an email to over 60 people, including other candidates and members of the media, slandering and threatening the Jewish Community Relations Council, a Bay Area public affairs group, and congregants of Oakland’s Temple Sinai synagogue. Liu also accused both organizations of unfairly excluding him and other mayoral candidates from an upcoming forum at the temple. “I am sick of these corrupt Jews and their media allies deceiving the public,” Liu wrote, invoking an antisemitic trope in which Jewish people are accused of nefariously controlling mass media outlets. And today, Liu threatened Temple Sinai, saying in his latest mass email that he would “notify all national veteran organizations” about his grievance against the temple. He followed this up with another email stating, “I am not afraid of jail. I long overcame fear of getting killed, I was a combat veteran. If I die, I die on righteous grounds. I fear no enemies at this point.” Reached by telephone, Liu told The Oaklanside he believes there is “Jew supremacy” in Oakland and worldwide, echoing conspiracy theories that have long been used to target and persecute Jewish people. The Oaklandside has chosen not to quote much of what Liu said during our interview and in his emails. Many of his comments were based on racist, homophobic, and antisemitic views that have no basis in fact. Such views have gained increasing numbers of adherents on the internet in recent years, especially with the rise of once-fringe candidates like Donald Trump who come to power while peddling racist myths. These ideologies have fueled far-right violence in recent years, including mass shootings. Groups specifically singled out by Liu—Jewish, Black, queer and trans people—have also been targeted by such violence. For instance, in 2018, 11 members of Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh were murdered by a white supremacist. “Comments like these contribute to a darkening environment of antisemitism,” said Tye Gregory, CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council, the group organizing the mayoral forum. “There’s kind of two sides to the coin here,” Gregory continued. “One one hand we don’t want a fringe candidate with these beliefs to have an elevated platform. On the other hand, it’s a good reminder why the Jewish community decided to have its own forum.” Gregory said the Oakland police are aware of Liu’s comments and that OPD will be present at the Temple forum. “It’s unfortunate that we have to have that kind of security,” he said. “Our houses of worship are supposed to be places inviting for everybody.” Although Liu denies that his recent comments are inflammatory and said he means no harm to anyone, he has a history of harmful speech aimed at minority groups. In 2018, when he ran for mayor, Liu took to Twitter to blame his dismal performance on “Jews shamelessly rigging elections via owning [and] controlling mass media.” In 2017, he urged a boycott of Disney because they “sneak gay scenes into innocent kids’ movies.” He said he was subsequently banned from Twitter for hate speech. The Oaklandside reviewed Liu’s old tweets, which he saved on Facebook, for this story. Liu is one of 10 candidates running for mayor this year . His platform includes building giant water slides in parks and allowing people to carry concealed firearms. He describes himself as a self-made millionaire and said his views about the world are shaped by his Christian beliefs. He told The Oaklandside that he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder in 2015 after serving in the military. As of Tuesday afternoon, Liu had sent over 17 responses in the same email chain, lobbing more accusations tinged with hate speech at the Jewish community forum’s organizers, even as fellow candidates and other observers urged him to stop. Quickly condemned by other candidates in the Oakland mayor’s race The discussion unfolding on Liu’s email thread follows several weeks of a broader conversation around participation and visibility in the Oakland mayoral race. This conversation intensified last month when a city clerk’s error led to the disqualification of multiple candidates for mayor. Candidates spoke out about what they saw as an undermining of the democratic process in the city. In a field of 10 candidates, some have also raised concerns about other forums and debates that featured only a few people running. For instance, an event hosted by Visit Oakland, a nonprofit partly funded by taxpayer dollars, and the Jack London Improvement District included only three candidates: Treva Reid, Loren Taylor, and Sheng Thao, all current members of Oakland’s City Council. Reid, Taylor, and Thao are also the only candidates invited to the upcoming forum hosted by Temple Sinai and the Jewish Community Relations Council. Any private group or organization can decide to host a mayoral forum and invite whoever they choose. Tye Gregory of JCRC said the event’s organizers decided who to invite based on fundraising status; they went with the three candidates who have raised the most money so far. Mayoral candidate Tyron Jordan told The Oaklandside that he thinks “all 10 qualified candidates should be invited to participate in forums,” attributing the exclusion to “oversight” in some cases and a decision not to invite certain candidates in others. But that’s no excuse for bigotry, Jordan said. “I absolutely deplore Peter Liu’s anti-[Semitic] comments…We’ve seen the consequences of hate speech, particularly over the past few years.” Other candidates also rebuked Liu by responding to his email. “If you want to criticize a forum sponsor for how they prioritize candidates whom they choose to invite to their privately hosted event, that is wholly appropriate and I will support your right to do so, exercising your free speech,” wrote Taylor, one of the recipients of Liu’s original email. “However, I will not stand idly by and remain silent when you make generalizations about an entire race of people, perpetuating inaccurate stereotypes that undermine the foundations of the strong, unified, and diverse community most of us endeavor to build and strengthen here in Oakland.” Gregory Hodge, another candidate for mayor who was not invited to the forum, wrote that it is “unacceptable to engage in any anti-Asian, anti-Semitic, anti-Black, anti-trans or any other form of oppressive behavior and language. Period. Hard stop.” And Hodge defended the temple’s decision only to invite three of the 10 candidates running for mayor. “The organizations who choose to provide forums for candidates to share their views and their approaches to healing the hurt in our City, are within their rights to invite anyone to participate based on any criteria that they believe relevant,” he wrote. Candidate Seneca Scott criticized for suggesting a protest at the temple The first response to Liu’s email on Sunday was from Seneca Scott, a West Oakland resident and founder of the entertainment company Oakhella who is also running for mayor. Scott replied to Liu’s email within two minutes with just one word: “Protest!?!” Liu wrote back that they should organize a sideshow—a demonstration of illegal stunt car racing—in front of the temple. Several people posted screenshots of this exchange on social media. Among them was Cat Brooks, an activist and Oakland mayoral candidate in 2018. Brooks wrote that she interpreted Scott’s comment as an endorsement of Liu’s anti-Jewish views. And it just keeps getting worse.  Shame on you Peter Liu and apparently – along with all of his other vile traits – turns out Seneca Scott is an anti-Semite as well #shutdownseneca #nohateinourtown pic.twitter.com/8Szlyc62r7 — Cat Brooks (@CatsCommentary) September 4, 2022 “His response was absolutely inappropriate,” Brooks said in an interview with The Oaklandside. “This can’t be divorced from what’s happening nationally, the political base that Trump built.” She said it’s dangerous to endorse the idea of a protest at a Jewish temple at a time when hate crimes are rising. Just days before Scott responded to Liu’s incendiary email, Brooks had taken to Twitter to share “grave concern” about Scott’s candidacy. Scott told The Oaklandside today that he is “absolutely not antisemitic” and that his reply was meant only to express frustration with the fact that some candidates have been invited to appear in public political forums and others have not. Later in the email thread, he encouraged Liu to apologize “to let folks know you are not making a blanket statement about Jews.” “It’s just way too loaded as is,” Scott added. Scott has faced criticism in recent months due to a recent photograph in which he posed next to a well-known transphobic activist named Chris Elston . Elston, who is known for spreading misinformation about the kinds of medical treatments provided to young transgender people, visited the Oakland First Fridays event in June wearing sandwich boards printed with transphobic hate messages. Scott agreed to be photographed wearing one of the sandwich boards, and Elston later posted the photo to Twitter. I keep making friends. I’m hanging out with Oakland mayoral candidate Seneca Scott. @Seneca4Mayor He’s an independent candidate who knows we shouldn’t be blocking puberty in children! Vote for this beautiful man!  ❤️ pic.twitter.com/UoDSGsbyAV — Billboard Chris 🇨🇦🇺🇸 (@BillboardChris) June 4, 2022 Scott told The Oaklandside that was the first and only time he’d met Elston and that he knew little to nothing about medical treatments offered for trans people, but agreed to wear the sign after listening to Elston talk about the issue. He said he didn’t read the sign before putting it on, and called the move a mistake in a conversation today. “I don’t agree with those statements,” he said. “I don’t agree with that guy.” Oakhella, the entertainment company Scott co-founded in 2016, distanced itself from him over the weekend with a statement posted on Instagram. “Oakhella was founded on the pillars of food justice, community co-creation, inclusion, and celebrating everything that is beautiful about Oakland. We especially create space for Queer and Trans people, and have done so since day one,” it read. “We all shared these values in our founding, and as we have been made aware, one of our co-founders has strayed from this vision in their pursuit of political office. We have intentionally remained as neutral as possible in the Oakland Mayoral race, but when we are openly associated with Transphobia, we have to make it clear that WE DO NOT SHARE THOSE SENTIMENTS.” Not the first time Liu has shared hateful views or targeted the Temple Sinai During his first mayoral run in 2014, Liu criticized Temple Sinai for not inviting him to participate in its mayoral debate. According to emails Liu posted to his extensive Oakland Wiki page, the temple invited only candidates who were receiving support from at least 5% of likely voters in recent independent polls. Liu was not among them. Zennie Abraham, an independent video blogger and longtime Oakland political commentator who was also a recipient of Liu’s emails over the past several days, responded to Liu that he feels threatened and harassed and that he’s considering taking action under the city’s hate crimes law .

Tell us about yourself.\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tI am Tyron Jordan and I am running as a true progressive in the race for Mayor of Oakland. I served as a Senator Bernie Sanders delegate-at-large at the Democratic National Convention in 2020, I am a former shop steward/ union organizer for SEIU local 1000, a former Mayoral appointee, and a military veteran. In addition, I serve on the Board of Directors of a West Oakland based non-profit.\r\nI was born in Ventura, California but lived most of the time in Northern California. I moved to Oakland in 2009.  I attended Fairfield High School, where I was a track and field standout; and I am currently an avid marathon runner. I am an avid reader; primarily of history and biography.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tPlease list below 3 key messages of your campaign. What are the main points you want voters to remember about your goals for your time in office?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\nReduce Homelessness to a point where it is a rarity\nRevitalize Small Business\nMaintain Public Safety without criminalizing homelessness, mental illness or substance abuse\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhat areas of public policy are you personally passionate about?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tI feel that the homelessness situation is at a crisis level. Having individuals and families, living in tents, under bridges and parks; is unacceptable at every level. Providing more shelters have  become a “permanent “ solution. What is needed for unhoused people to thrive and to fully participate in their communities; is permanent safe steady housing.\n\n   Despite misconceptions; a significant number of those who are unhoused, are employed. The soaring cost of housing has made it impossible to afford.  The common approach of letting developers come in, with the promise of providing a percentage of affordable units; must be re-examined. This approach has proven  to be ineffective.\r\n In the situation of the unhoused, who are struggling with mental health issues/ drug abuse; they need stable housing along with a strong social support systems. The Housing First approach, along with treatment have been tried and successful in many cities. When I moved to Oakland in 2009, one of the top issues was the increasing level of homelessness\r\n\nIn 2022, the top issue remains to be the increasing level of homelessness. In that span of time, City Council members have come and gone, and Mayors have come and gone. It is time to take a serious comprehensive approach to help people get off the streets, and help them utilize their talents and potential. Such  a step would benefit us all. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWho do you look up to? Whose example would you like to follow, and why?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tI greatly admired United Farm worker co-founder Dolores Huerta, I admired former President Obama, the late Civil leader/Congressman John Lewis .\r\nI admire these individuals, because of their determination, especially against terrible odds.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhat characteristics or principles are most important for an elected official?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tBeing trustworthy.

What does that mean to you?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tA Mayor should set the tone, should have a vision, and should be able to lead in a decisive fashion. A Mayor should be more than a person “putting out fires”, but should have definite goals and objectives. \n\n A mayor must be highly ethical and trustworthy on all levels. \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tMayors have many responsibilities, which vary from city to city.

Most importantly, I feel, that the Mayor of Oakland, must be fully engaged with every segment of the community/ across all socio-economic segments \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tIf the mayor in your city is not a member of the city council and oversees the day-to-day administration of the city government, what do you believe is the ideal relationship between the mayor and city council?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tI think the City Council should be a partner in governing; but the mayor should make the final decisions \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhat do you love most about your city?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tThe sheer racial diversity and diverse cultures. Oakland is a very vibrant city with energy which one can almost feel.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhat do you perceive to be your city's greatest challenges over the next decade?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tRebounding economically. The pandemic has had a devastating impact \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhat do you believe is the ideal relationship between your city and the state government?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tA partnership \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhat do you believe is the ideal relationship between your city and the federal government?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tA partnership \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\tWhat do you believe is the ideal relationship between the mayor's office and law enforcement?\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n \n\t\t\t\tA degree of independence, but still some input \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Ballotpedia reserves the right to edit Candidate Connection survey responses.

Thank you for supporting The Oaklandside and being a part of our community. A donation to The Oaklandside goes beyond the newsroom. We amplify community voices, share the power of real information, and investigate systems, not just symptoms. Donate We’ve invited nine of the 10 people running to be the next mayor of Oakland to sit down with us for in-depth interviews, asking them mostly the same questions. Such as, how many police officers does the Oakland Police Department need? How would they help the City Council and the city administration work together better? How would they fix Oakland’s potholes? We developed these questions with help from hundreds of Oakland residents who answered our election survey this summer; thank you to everyone who weighed in. Oakland mayoral candidate interviews Greg Hodge Seneca Scott Loren Taylor Ignacio De La Fuente Sheng Thao Treva Reid Allyssa Victory John Reimann Tyron Jordan Settle in for a long read; these conversations are weighty, befitting the office these candidates seek. They’ve been edited for length, relevance, and clarity, with some added fact-checking and background reading from us. (And note that we decided not to interview candidate Peter Liu and provide another platform for his dangerous and hateful rhetoric. ) This interview is with Tyron Jordan, a paralegal in the California Attorney General’s office.  Jordan sits on the city’s Library Advisory Commission and is a member of the Oakland Rotary Club, where he volunteers with the KinderPrep committee, which distributes books to low-income families to encourage a love of reading from an early age. He also volunteers with the Veterans of Foreign Wars, where he helps veterans obtain housing, healthcare, and mental health assistance. In recent years there have been several examples of tension between the City Council and city administrator. Oftentimes the City Council doesn’t feel like the city administrator is enacting the policies and laws that they’ve approved. On the other hand, the city administration often feels like the City Council is overstepping or loading up their plate with too much work, things like that. If you were elected mayor, how would you repair this relationship? There should be more open communication between the city administration and members of the City Council. They might have the best interest of Oakland at heart but they have their different agendas. They may not be on the same page. The city administrator and the members of the City Council need to meet on a regular basis so they can build rapport. Regarding the last budget that was written by the mayor and approved by the City Council with amendments, was there anything in it that you objected to, that you would have cut as mayor? And anything left out that you feel should have been included? Offhand I can’t think of anything. Mayor Libby Schaaf has done an exceptional job of raising private money from philanthropic sources to meet some of her big goals rather than going through the city budget. What do you think of this approach? Is it good for Oakland? Is it something you would also do as mayor? I would concentrate more of my efforts as a mayor on making our city equitable, representing our people, and doing what’s in the best interest of residents, improving the quality of life of residents, whether they live in the flatlands or the hills. That would be my major point of focus. Oakland is thousands of units short of meeting the affordable housing goals set by the region and state, the so-called RHNA goals. Would expanding affordable housing in Oakland be a goal of yours? If so, what concrete steps would you take? How would market-rate development and social housing fit into this plan? It’s a two-tier [solution]. I think we need to help prevent those most vulnerable from becoming homeless from losing their homes and apartments. To do that, we need to institute a rental assistance program which was very prevalent during the peak of the COVID crisis. [ Editor’s note: The COVID-19 rental relief program used state funds to help tenants make up missed rental payments, but most of the funding has been committed and the program is no longer taking applications. ] I also believe those who are living in homes—even though the vast majority of Oakland residents are renters there are still some who are living in homes—I think many of them are also at risk of becoming homeless. For them, we should kickstart or expand a mortgage assistance program. We need to take a look at some of the vacant properties we have, foreclosed and unoccupied properties, and we should purchase these lands and structures and convert them to affordable housing. You said continuing the rental assistance was available during COVID would be a priority. The funding for that was state and federal. If the federal or state governments don’t provide more money for that, how would you continue that program? There’s an infrastructure and housing bond initiative. I think we could get funds from that. [ Editor’s note: Jordan is referring to Measure U , the $850 million affordable housing and infrastructure bond that’s on the ballot this year. We aren’t sure if rental assistance would be  allowable under Measure U, since the measure states that funds should be used only to pay for physical infrastructure. ] As mayor, what policies and programs would you pursue to help get the 5,000 unhoused people into shelters and off our streets? How would you balance pressing safety concerns like fires at camps with pleas from the community not to criminalize people trying to survive? I would like to see everyone move into permanent housing, but that’s not going to happen immediately. We need to spend more on mini-housing, I believe they’re called ADUs [accessory dwelling units]. But it’s a balancing act. People want to help the homeless but they don’t want it in their backyard. They don’t want encampments near them. It’s going to be hard. We need to house unhoused people somewhere. There will be some backlash, but the encampments need to be secured. They need hygienic facilities. There should be some apparatus for order in those encampments, security, and that sort of thing, to make it more palatable. One of the biggest challenges business owners say they are dealing with is the rising cost of goods due to global supply chain issues. Have you thought about any local solutions to remedying this national problem? I really don’t know where to start with that, to be honest. I know that every small business owner is feeling the punch of prices rising. That’s something I would need to give more thought to. Do you feel like the position of Oakland mayor actually isn’t well suited to solving these problems? Are they too national and global in scope? One of the tangible powers of being mayor is that I would have a platform. If I talk about economic problems, I would be heard. I would use my platform as mayor as a bully pulpit to express my views on how we can help small businesses. But as far as on a practice level, for what I could do day to day, I don’t know how much power I would really have as mayor, even though I would really like to help. Both the Coliseum and Arena are huge entertainment hubs for the city. Regardless of what the A’s end up doing, going to Howard Terminal or leaving the city altogether, what do you envision for the future of the Coliseum and Arena site? I was initially opposed to the Howard Terminal project. I thought Oakland voters should have had a vote to determine whether or not the project happens. It looks like it’ll happen no matter what though. But I want the A’s and the city to provide affordable housing, a substantial percentage of it. I think the A’s should also provide high-paying jobs. And we need to consider the environmental impact of all that construction. I want them to take that into account and use safeguards. A lot of money is at stake and I want the community to have a slice of the economic pie, not a symbolic slice. Sorry, let me rewind. I mentioned Howard Terminal but we’re actually not that interested in that project. The question is more about the Coliseum and Arena site. Assuming the A’s leave, what’s your plan for that site? I would want to reuse that as a venue for various kinds of entertainment and art events. It could be a venue for job training and job fairs. I would utilize that space as much as possible. A lot can be done in that area. Do you support any of the plans to bring a WNBA team to play at the Arena? I think that would be good. I support that. It would be good for Oakland and good economically. Public Schools in Oakland are run by OUSD and charter management organizations. But that hasn’t stopped Mayor Schaaf from including education as one of her platforms with programs like Oakland Undivided, Oakland Promise, and the Teacher Residency Program. What do you think the mayor’s role should be in getting involved in public education issues in Oakland? The mayor should play a very significant role. I approve of the role that Mayor Libby Schaaf has played. Of course, the mayor can’t put their hands into the business of OUSD. But as mayor, there is often influence, a platform where you can make proposals. It’s essential for the mayor to express their opinion on our school system. It’s part of the job. Right now the school district is embroiled in controversy because they’ve closed some schools in recent years and will be closing some more at the end of this year. For years now, the district has had serious financial troubles and that’s the reason they say they’re closing schools. But there’s also this debate in Oakland with some people saying it’s the charter schools that have caused financial insecurity for OUSD, leading to school closures. What’s your view on these issues? One of the reasons that have been given for closing schools is to save money because the schools are being underutilized. But I haven’t read any study that shows closing schools saves money. I feel most of the schools they’re closing or discussing closure for are ones that have a high percentage of students of color and students with disabilities and special needs. I don’t think charter schools are going anywhere. They’re here to stay. I prefer that every public school has the right funding and staff for every student to have a quality education. But the butting of heads between public school supporters and charter school supporters—I think the two groups should work together. You’ve never held elected office before. We’d love to hear you reflect on the gaps and inexperience you will have if you were elected mayor. How would you make up for this lack of experience? I would certainly come in with many gaps. I’ve held appointed office but never elected office. If I have shortcomings around certain issues or subjects then I go to the people who know about those things. I find the folks who have a proven track record of making things happen. I would bring in folks who have—not necessarily under Libby Schaaf—but people who have experience in Oakland government, and those in nongovernment roles. I’m not shy of acknowledging what I don’t know. Being mayor is a major job. It’s not a nine-to-five type of job. Regarding the conditions of streets in Oakland, there are many potholes and lots of needed paving. There are many poorly designed streets, and crosswalks need to be improved. What do you think the department of transportation’s focus should be? We have horrible streets. I’m a jogger. I jog around Oakland all the time and see the horrible streets. Some of these roads are just hazardous. They’re dangerous to drive and ride on. Potholes are the job of public works. We also have a department of transportation. There should be a centralized rapid-response team to fill some of these potholes. If they’re short-staffed on maintenance crews then we need to hire more crews. [ Editor’s note: OakDot and public works both have a 20% vacancy rate in budgeted positions. In other words, one in five positions in these departments isn’t filled currently. ] When Measure KK was implemented a few years ago it covered a bit of ground but there’s still a lot to go. How would you grade OakDOT and public works right now? Are they doing what they should be doing or would you revamp these city departments? I think they should continue doing what they’ve been doing. But there are not enough workers to do the job. Oakland has 400,000 people but there’s a lack of manpower. What should be a bigger priority: building new roads for cars, or infrastructure like paths for bikes and pedestrians? I think it’s a combination of both. Frankly, if it was up to me, everyone would be riding a bike in order to help save the environment. But that’s not practical. That’s only in my mind. We need to repair roads for drivers and it’s equally necessary to repair the roads for bicyclists and pedestrians. It’s not an either-or. Readers who took our election survey wanted us to ask about police staffing. Oakland has 681 officers right now. Is that too few or too many? Can you explain your thinking? That [number] sounds about right to me. We have seen an uptick in crime but I don’t think adding more police will prevent crime. I think the 600-plus [officers we currently have] is adequate. I wouldn’t increase that amount nor would I decrease it. Can you briefly explain why you think adding police wouldn’t necessarily help reduce crime? From what I’ve read, every study I’ve ever read, increasing the number of police officers [doesn’t have an impact]. Police officers respond. I don’t see how increasing their numbers to 700, 800, or 900 would actually stop crime. In Chinatown and Little Saigon crime has happened even with a higher police presence there. More police won’t have a big impact in preventing criminals from taking the opportunity to commit crimes. Gun violence is one of our city’s biggest problems. What’s your plan as mayor to address gun violence? When people refer to gun violence they automatically are referring to shootings in the streets, or the recent shooting at King Estates , or City Hall. But there’s also gun violence in domestic situations and by people contemplating suicide. Our first priority should be to get guns off the street. We should closely collaborate with the federal government with background checks and take away guns from domestic abusers: not just assault rifles but handguns as well. I think we need all hands on deck to have a comprehensive program. I’m ex-Army and I find these recent shootings shocking. The scary part about it is it could happen to anyone in any place. We need to severely limit access to guns. There are too many guns out there. [ Editor’s note: The city of Oakland and even the state of California have little power to limit the accessibility of firearms due to the current interpretation of the Second Amendment by the Supreme Court, which posits that individuals have a right to own firearms with few restrictions. The Supreme Court also recently struck down a New York State law that prohibited the concealed carrying of guns in public. California’s similar law is now being challenged. The lax firearms laws in neighboring states like Nevada and Arizona also ensure that there’s a steady flow of illegal guns into California. ] We’re assuming you’re familiar with the Ceasefire program and the Department of Violence Prevention . Those are two of the ways Oakland currently tries to prevent and respond to gun violence. Do you have thoughts about these? Are they working? I think DVP is doing a good job with what they have, as long as they remain fully funded. It’s such a complex problem though, all hands must be on deck. We need more police officers. We need more programs like DVP. We need everyone involved to put an end to this. This is crazy about what’s going on. [ Editor’s note: As of Oct. 9 , over 100 people have been murdered in Oakland in 2022, a rate that’s much higher than the average over the past 10 years. ] Do you think police misconduct is still a problem in Oakland? If you do, what’s your plan to ensure OPD continues to make progress in reforming itself? I don’t think it’s a huge problem. It’s not as bad as it used to be. The police commission has teeth and has been doing a good job keeping track and holding officers accountable for misconduct. One thing that’s still a problem is when police who do engage in misconduct just move to the next city and keep working as police officers. If an officer has a track record of misconduct they shouldn’t be able to move somewhere else and keep being a police officer. That’s my view. Do you think the police commission has enough resources? One thing I’m not certain of is whether or not they have the power to subpoena records [from the police department]. If they don’t have it, that’s something we should look into. [ Editor’s note: the police commission does have the power to subpoena records from OPD and compel testimony from officers and witnesses. It was given this power when it was created in 2016 and this authority was clarified in 2020. ] Before you go... Can you help us make a difference?

Jerry Brown signed legislation Padilla sponsored in the state Senate banning single-use plastic bags at grocery store checkouts in the state of California.[28] Padilla, a nominee for the open secretary of state seat in the 2014 elections, faced ads opposing him in the months prior to the bill's approval.[29][28]\n\nTop-two primary system\nPadilla, running for California Secretary of State in 2014 on the promise of free and fair elections, expressed concern over the ballot access limitations affecting minor parties due to new requirements implemented in 2012 with the top-two primary system. Under those new qualifications, minor party candidates must collect 10,000 signatures to waive a filing fee equal to two percent of the first year's salary for state offices or one percent for members of Congress. Prior to implementing the top-two system, the number of signatures required to waive that fee was 150, so most minor parties opted to file petitions. Senator Padilla's office said in February 2014 it was looking into legislative solutions to improve ballot access for minor parties.[30][31]\n\n\nPrimary election background\nInformation about the race background can be found by clicking [show] at the right. \nPrimary election\nStances on top-two primary system\nOne of the key issues of the 2014 secretary of state primary was the signature and filing requirements for minor party candidates under California's top-two primary system. Under new qualifications implemented with the top-two primary system, minor party candidates must collect 10,000 signatures to waive a filing fee equal to 2 percent of the first year's salary for state offices or 1 percent for members of Congress. Prior to implementing the top-two system, the number of signatures required to waive that fee was 150, so most minor parties opted to file petitions. \nAfter launching their campaigns for California Secretary of State, California State Senator Alex Padilla (D) and ex-state Sen. Leland Yee (D), who ultimately had to withdraw from the race after he was arrested in March 2014, expressed concerns about ballot access limitations for minor parties under the top-two primary system. Yee opposed the top-two system during his time in the California State Senate and Senator Padilla said his office was looking into legislative solutions.[32][33] Green Party candidate David Scott Curtis campaigned against the top-two system while independent candidate Dan Schnur, who was designated \"no party preference\" on the ballot since California’s Proposition 14 took away candidates' \"independent\" label option, was in favor of the system. Democrat Derek Cressman openly opposed the system but did not focus on the issue during his campaign. \nAlso in the race, Democrat Jeff Drobman and two Republicans, Pete Peterson and Roy Allmond, had not made their stances on the top-two system known prior to the primary. \n\nCandidates excluded from debate\nA California non-profit association called the Sacramento Press Club incited the ire of Green Party candidate David Scott Curtis after failing to invite him and two other 2014 secretary of state candidates to participate in an April 23 debate.[34] With seven candidates in the running, the Sacramento Press Club said they wanted to restrict the size of the event by only including \"top contenders in a crowded field,\" whom they determined to be Pete Peterson (R), state Sen. Alex Padilla (D), Dan Schnur (I) and Derek Cressman (D). By the time Curtis learned of his exclusion, back-to-back Field Polls had been released showing Curtis ahead of both Schnur and Cressman. Absent an immediate explanation or apology from the Sacramento Press Club, Curtis used social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to broadcast his outrage over what he considered a conspicuous display of political bias by the tax-exempt organization. Curtis also filed an IRS investigation request related to the group's tax-exempt status.[35] A press club representative characterized Curtis's actions as a \"tirade of insulting and threatening social media posts\" against the organization. The Green Party hopeful questioned what such selectivity meant for the state of 'journalism' in an attempt to highlight the significance of the snub. Curtis also noted that some of the major-party candidates were already known for courting media attention. Schnur was known for furnishing the Capitol press, whose members make up a large portion of the Sacramento Press Club, with sound bites and other material. Schnur was one of the two candidates to receive invitations to the debate hosted by the press club despite trailing Curtis in the polls. Joe Mathews, the California editor at Zocalo Public Square, wrote, “Of course, I’m for Dan Schnur for Secretary of State. I’m in the media, and he’s our candidate...He’s the favored candidate of our state’s political media, which feeds us polls and old, bogus narratives about the state.”[34] Meanwhile, Northern California's chapter of The Society of Professional Journalists honored Leland Yee with its Public Official Award shortly before Yee's arrest forced him to exit the race.[34]\n\nYee Arrest\nOn March 26, 2014, Democratic candidate Leland Yee was arraigned on seven charges of corruption and firearms trafficking. Yee, along with 25 others, was involved in an FBI operation to uncover those suspected of illegal activities involving drugs, guns and arranging murder for hire. Yee's alleged illegal activities stemmed from his debt acquired in a failed run for San Francisco mayor in 2011 and money raised for the Secretary of State race. Authorities believed Yee accepted money for official actions performed while in office. These actions included urging an agency to accept a software contract from a specific vendor in exchange for $10,000, writing a Senate proclamation to honor the Chee Kung Tong group for $6,800 and introducing a medical marijuana businessman to state legislators working on the issue for $21,000. Unknown to Yee, all of these paying contacts were undercover agents. In other attempts to raise money, Yee allegedly promised to help other undercover agents obtain illegal guns from an international arms dealer.[36]\nDespite no longer being in the race, Yee's name remained on the primary ballot.\n\n\n\n2010\nSee also: California State Senate elections, 2010\nPadilla won re-election to the 20th District seat in 2010.

Its purpose is to inform voters about the legislator’s political positions. Because scorecards have varying purposes and methodologies, each report should be considered on its own merits. For example, an advocacy group’s scorecard may assess a legislator’s voting record on one issue while a state newspaper’s scorecard may evaluate the voting record in its entirety.\nBallotpedia is in the process of developing an encyclopedic list of published scorecards.

            "wiki_text": "Alejandro \"Alex\" Padilla (born March 22, 1973) is an American politician serving as the senior United States senator from California, a seat he has held since 2021. A member of the Democratic Party, Padilla served as the 30th secretary of state of California from 2015 to 2021 and was a member of the California State Senate and the Los Angeles City Council.Governor Gavin Newsom appointed Padilla to the United States Senate after then-Senator Kamala Harris was elected Vice President of the United States; Harris, as the newly elected vice president and president of the Senate, swore Padilla in on January 20, 2021. In dual November 2022 elections, Padilla won a special election to complete Harris's term as well as election to a full Senate term, defeating Republican nominee Mark Meuser in both.Padilla became California's senior senator on September 29, 2023, upon the death of Dianne Feinstein.\n\nEarly life and education\nPadilla is one of three children of Santos and Lupe Padilla, both of whom immigrated from Mexico, specifically Jalisco and Chihuahua, before meeting and marrying in Los Angeles, where he was born. He grew up in Pacoima, Los Angeles, and graduated from San Fernando High School in the northeast San Fernando Valley. He earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1994. He graduated from the Coro Fellows Southern California Program in 1995.\n\nEarly career\nLos Angeles\nAfter graduation, Padilla moved back to Pacoima and briefly worked as an engineer for Hughes Aircraft, where he wrote software for satellite systems.Padilla is a former member of the governing board of MIT and president of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO), which has a membership of more than 6,000 Latino U.S. officials. He has chaired the Los Angeles Leadership Council for the American Diabetes Association since 2005.Padilla began in politics as a member of the Democratic Party in 1995, in substantial part in response to California Proposition 187, which excluded illegal immigrants from all non-emergency public services, including public education, but which he felt was motivated by a broader nativism that demonized legal and illegal immigrants alike. His first professional role was as a personal assistant to Senator Dianne Feinstein. He then served as a campaign manager for Assemblyman Tony Cárdenas in 1996, Assemblyman Gil Cedillo in 1997, and State Senator Richard Alarcon in 1998, all Democrats. All won their respective elections.\n\nLos Angeles City Council\nOn July 1, 1999, at age 26, Padilla was sworn in as a member of the Los Angeles City Council. Two years later, his colleagues elected him council president. Padilla was the first Latino and the youngest person elected president of the Los Angeles City Council, defeating incumbent Ruth Galanter. On September 13, 2001, two days after the 9/11 attacks, Padilla became the acting mayor of Los Angeles for a couple of days while Mayor James K. Hahn traveled out of the city. Los Angeles Times wrote that Padilla's rise to the mayor's office raised his \"political stock\".During his term as City Council president, Padilla also was elected president of the California League of Cities, the first Latino to serve in that position.\n\nCalifornia State Senate\nAfter retiring as president of the Los Angeles City Council, Padilla was elected to the State Senate in 2006, defeating Libertarian Pamela Brown. He was reelected in 2010 with nearly 70% of the vote over Republican Kathleen Evans. Padilla served as a member of the Appropriations Committee, Business and Professions and Economic Development Committee, Governmental Organization Committee, Labor and Industrial Relations Committee, and chaired the Select Committee on Science, Innovation and Public Policy. He left office on November 30, 2014, after two terms.In August 2012, Padilla was included in a list of 20 Latino political rising stars compiled by the San Francisco Chronicle, citing his role in the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.In September 2014, Padilla promoted what would later become Proposition 67, a proposed ban on plastic bags. On November 8, 2016, when Padilla was Secretary of State, the proposal was voted on in a referendum, and the option in favor of the ban on plastic bags received 53% of the vote. Padilla authored legislation that passed in 2008 requiring some restaurants to disclose calorie information on menus.\n\n30th Secretary of State of California (2015–2021)\nOn April 11, 2013, Padilla announced his intention to run for California secretary of state in 2014, to succeed the term-limited Debra Bowen. He was expected to face an intraparty battle with fellow Democrat Leland Yee, but Yee's arrest for felony racketeering caused Yee to abandon the race. Padilla won the election on November 4, 2014, with 53.6% of the vote, defeating Republican Pete Peterson.On June 29, 2017, the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which President Donald Trump created on May 11, requested data on enrolled voters from every state, dating back to 2006. Padilla said that California would not supply the data.On November 6, 2018, Padilla was reelected with 64.5% of the vote, defeating Republican Mark P. Meuser.On October 16, 2020, Padilla was involved in a controversy between the state and the California Republican Party, as the party deployed unofficial ballot boxes for voters to submit their ballots at select locations, including churches and gun stores in competitive California districts. Padilla issued a cease-and-desist order, arguing that the ballot boxes were illegal and failed to ensure ballot security. Local Republican leadership refused to follow the order and said the boxes were a form of legal ballot harvesting that had been enabled by recent Democratic legislation (which lacked a chain of custody requirement), and were a way to increase voter turnout. Accusing Democrats of hypocrisy given their widespread door-to-door ballot harvesting in the 2018 United States elections, the state Republican Party later agreed to a set of collection procedures and said a volunteer's mistake of affixing a sign denoting the ballot box as \"official\" had contributed to the political standoff; Padilla's office said it was continuing to investigate whether ballots were being handled correctly and that the \"ineptitude or unlawfulness of a political operative or campaign volunteer\" could nonetheless lead to \"serious legal consequences\".In early 2020, Padilla announced a $35 million no-bid contract for a statewide voter education ad campaign with partisan public relations firm SKDK (then known as \"SKDKnickerbocker\") called \"Vote Safe California\", but State Controller Betty Yee blocked the funding because Padilla's office did not have the authority to use federal money that was allocated to county governments; the campaign proceeded anyway. The group had marketed itself as being on \"Team Biden\", and the awarding of the no-bid contract under supposed \"emergency powers\" despite the group's ties with the Democratic Party and work for Democratic politicians running for office in California received bipartisan criticism. Amid ongoing litigation by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, who contend that the contract bypassed fair competition rules and misappropriated federal election funding for local elections operations, and was therefore illegal, Governor Newsom signed legislation that provided state funding to reimburse SKDK in February 2021.Upon Padilla's appointment to the U.S. Senate, Newsom appointed Assemblywoman Shirley Weber to succeed him.\n\nUnited States Senator from California (2021–present)\nAppointment\nIn August 2020, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden selected California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. After they won the general election, Padilla was mentioned as a possible choice as Harris's successor in the Senate. Governor Newsom had the power to appoint her successor. In December 2020, Newsom announced that he would appoint Padilla to the seat, making him California's first Hispanic senator and the first male U.S. senator from California since Alan Cranston retired in 1993. During the speculation about whom Newsom would appoint, the senior senator from California, Dianne Feinstein, supported Padilla. To replace Padilla as California's secretary of state, Newsom appointed state assemblywoman Shirley Weber.Most Latinos, who are 40% of California's population, supported Padilla's appointment, but some black leaders, who wanted another black woman to replace Harris, criticized it. San Francisco Mayor London Breed called Padilla's appointment \"a real blow to the African American community\".\n\nElections\n2022\nPadilla announced that he would seek a full term in 2022. He appeared on two ballots: one for the special election to fill the remainder of his term in the 117th Congress, and the other for the new term beginning with the 118th Congress. The special election was due to a recent change in California law that ended Padilla's appointment in November 2022. He was on the ballot in two separate races in the November 2022 election—a special election for the final two months of Harris's Senate term, and a regular election for a full six-year term beginning in January 2023.\n\nTenure\nOn January 20, 2021, Padilla was sworn into the United States Senate in the 117th Congress by Vice President Kamala Harris, his predecessor, becoming the first Latino to represent California in the U.S. Senate. He was sworn in by Vice President Harris on her first day, at the same time as new Georgia senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. He served the final two years of Harris's term. He filed the necessary paperwork with the FEC to run for a full term and an unexpired term in the 2022 elections which he won in November 2022.\nWhile in office, Padilla introduced legislation to add more legal protections for various public lands in California, including parts of the San Gabriel Mountains,  Los Padres National Forest, and Carrizo Plain National Monument. Padilla also introduced legislation to help coastal communities adapt shorelines to increased flooding and erosion from sea level rise and extreme weather.\n\nCommittee assignments\nCommittee on the Judiciary\nSubcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety (Chairman)\nCommittee on the Budget\nCommittee on Environment and Public Works\nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\nCommittee on Rules and Administration\n\nCaucus memberships\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus\nSenate Cultural Caucus\nCongressional Asian Pacific American Caucus\nRare Disease Caucus\n\nPolitical positions\nThe Wall Street Journal says that Padilla had \"a reputation [in the State Senate] as a business-friendly moderate\". FiveThirtyEight defined him as a technocrat, not identified with either the progressive or the moderate wing of the party. The American Conservative Union gave Padilla a 0% rating in 2012. On January 18, 2021, Padilla released a statement in support of the Green New Deal and Medicare For All legislation, among other progressive policies.\n\nAbortion\nPadilla favors abortion rights, saying in 2018 that abortion rights are \"not negotiable\". In 2008, Padilla sponsored the bill SB 1770, which would require the Commission on Peace Officer Standards Training (POST) to prepare relevant guidelines and mechanisms for the investigation and reporting of \"cases involving anti-reproductive-rights crimes\". In 2018, after winning the primary for secretary of state to seek a second term, he received support from NARAL Pro-Choice America.When Roe v.

A progressive problem solver, Alex has dedicated his career to finding solutions to the toughest challenges and fighting for communities that are too often left out and left behind. Download Short Bio → Download Full Bio → Download Official Portrait → Early Days Alex Padilla is a lifelong Californian . He was born and raised in the proud, working class community of Pacoima, in the San Fernando Valley. Alex’s parents immigrated to Los Angeles from different parts of Mexico in the 1960s. Once in California, they met, fell in love, and applied for green cards. Alex’s parents had little formal education, but they shared a strong work ethic and big dreams. For forty years, Alex’s father worked as a short order cook in various Los Angeles diners. For the same forty years, his mom worked cleaning houses. They instilled in Alex, his sister, and his brother the importance of getting a good education as well as the value of service to others. As a result, Alex spent many weekends at community clean-ups and other neighborhood service projects. College & Education Alex attended Los Angeles public schools and graduated from San Fernando High School. While his first love was baseball, he also excelled in math and science. With the encouragement of several teachers, he applied and was accepted to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering. Entrance into Politics After graduating from MIT, Alex returned home eager to begin his career. However, a rising tide of anti-immigrant sentiment in California at the time drew Alex towards politics. He knew he had to take a stand against cynical rhetoric demonizing people like his parents, friends, and neighbors. In 1994, Alex joined protests against California’s Proposition 187, which sought to deny public benefits to immigrants. He went on to manage political campaigns for several legislative candidates and served as a field representative for Senator Dianne Feinstein. Career in Public Service In 1999, at the age of 26, Alex was elected to the Los Angeles City Council to represent the district where he grew up. In 2001, just two years later, he was elected by his colleagues to serve as President of the City Council—the youngest person in city history and the first Latino in over 100 years to hold the position. Alex served as acting Mayor of Los Angeles during the aftermath of 9/11, leading the city through a time of heightened security and tensions. As a council member, he worked to create economic opportunity zones in his district and reduce crime through improved community-police relations. In 2006, Alex was elected to California’s State Senate, where, over the course of two terms, he became known as one of California’s most effective state legislators. A problem-solver with an ability to build consensus, Alex authored landmark bills requiring nutritional information on restaurant menus, streamlining the process for community college students seeking to transfer to four-year universities, phasing out single-use plastic bags, and mandating the deployment of the state’s earthquake early warning system. For six years, he served as Chair of the State Senate Committee on Energy, Utilities, and Communications, where he was instrumental in developing California’s renewable energy and climate policies—among the most ambitious in the world—as well as expanding access to broadband and modernizing California’s electrical grid. In 2014, Alex was elected California Secretary of State, the first Latino in state history to serve in the office. As Secretary of State, he worked to make elections more accessible and inclusive while protecting the integrity of voting systems. Alex helped establish automatic and same-day voter registration, secured $500 million to upgrade California’s voting systems to meet higher security standards, and oversaw the implementation of the landmark Voter’s Choice Act, which expanded mail-in and in-person early voting. Under Alex’s leadership, the state reached a record high number of more than 22 million Californians registered to vote and the highest percentage of eligible citizens registered to vote in 80 years. U.S. Senate & Values In November of 2022, Alex was elected to the United States Senate. He began serving in January of 2021 after being appointed to fill the vacancy created by the election of Vice President Kamala Harris. He is the first Latino to represent California in the U.S. Senate. Alex’s top priority upon entering the U.S. Senate has been to address the COVID-19 pandemic and deliver equitable economic relief for working families and communities across California. Since being sworn in to office, Padilla has established himself as a champion of voting rights, climate action, and ensuring everyone has a fair shot at the American dream. Alex is the first Latino to serve as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety. His first bill, the Citizenship for Essential Workers Act, seeks to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who served as government-recognized essential workers in key sectors during the COVID-19 pandemic. He is also a member of the Senate Committees on Budget; Environment and Public Works; Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; Judiciary; and Rules. Alex lives in the San Fernando Valley with his wife, Angela, and their three sons, Roman, Alex, and Diego.

            "wiki_text": "Alejandro \"Alex\" Padilla (born March 22, 1973) is an American politician serving as the senior United States senator from California, a seat he has held since 2021. A member of the Democratic Party, Padilla served as the 30th secretary of state of California from 2015 to 2021 and was a member of the California State Senate and the Los Angeles City Council.Governor Gavin Newsom appointed Padilla to the United States Senate after then-Senator Kamala Harris was elected Vice President of the United States; Harris, as the newly elected vice president and president of the Senate, swore Padilla in on January 20, 2021. In dual November 2022 elections, Padilla won a special election to complete Harris's term as well as election to a full Senate term, defeating Republican nominee Mark Meuser in both.Padilla became California's senior senator on September 29, 2023, upon the death of Dianne Feinstein.\n\nEarly life and education\nPadilla is one of three children of Santos and Lupe Padilla, both of whom immigrated from Mexico, specifically Jalisco and Chihuahua, before meeting and marrying in Los Angeles, where he was born. He grew up in Pacoima, Los Angeles, and graduated from San Fernando High School in the northeast San Fernando Valley. He earned a degree in mechanical engineering from Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1994. He graduated from the Coro Fellows Southern California Program in 1995.\n\nEarly career\nLos Angeles\nAfter graduation, Padilla moved back to Pacoima and briefly worked as an engineer for Hughes Aircraft, where he wrote software for satellite systems.Padilla is a former member of the governing board of MIT and president of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials (NALEO), which has a membership of more than 6,000 Latino U.S. officials. He has chaired the Los Angeles Leadership Council for the American Diabetes Association since 2005.Padilla began in politics as a member of the Democratic Party in 1995, in substantial part in response to California Proposition 187, which excluded illegal immigrants from all non-emergency public services, including public education, but which he felt was motivated by a broader nativism that demonized legal and illegal immigrants alike. His first professional role was as a personal assistant to Senator Dianne Feinstein. He then served as a campaign manager for Assemblyman Tony Cárdenas in 1996, Assemblyman Gil Cedillo in 1997, and State Senator Richard Alarcon in 1998, all Democrats. All won their respective elections.\n\nLos Angeles City Council\nOn July 1, 1999, at age 26, Padilla was sworn in as a member of the Los Angeles City Council. Two years later, his colleagues elected him council president. Padilla was the first Latino and the youngest person elected president of the Los Angeles City Council, defeating incumbent Ruth Galanter. On September 13, 2001, two days after the 9/11 attacks, Padilla became the acting mayor of Los Angeles for a couple of days while Mayor James K. Hahn traveled out of the city. Los Angeles Times wrote that Padilla's rise to the mayor's office raised his \"political stock\".During his term as City Council president, Padilla also was elected president of the California League of Cities, the first Latino to serve in that position.\n\nCalifornia State Senate\nAfter retiring as president of the Los Angeles City Council, Padilla was elected to the State Senate in 2006, defeating Libertarian Pamela Brown. He was reelected in 2010 with nearly 70% of the vote over Republican Kathleen Evans. Padilla served as a member of the Appropriations Committee, Business and Professions and Economic Development Committee, Governmental Organization Committee, Labor and Industrial Relations Committee, and chaired the Select Committee on Science, Innovation and Public Policy. He left office on November 30, 2014, after two terms.In August 2012, Padilla was included in a list of 20 Latino political rising stars compiled by the San Francisco Chronicle, citing his role in the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials.In September 2014, Padilla promoted what would later become Proposition 67, a proposed ban on plastic bags. On November 8, 2016, when Padilla was Secretary of State, the proposal was voted on in a referendum, and the option in favor of the ban on plastic bags received 53% of the vote. Padilla authored legislation that passed in 2008 requiring some restaurants to disclose calorie information on menus.\n\n30th Secretary of State of California (2015–2021)\nOn April 11, 2013, Padilla announced his intention to run for California secretary of state in 2014, to succeed the term-limited Debra Bowen. He was expected to face an intraparty battle with fellow Democrat Leland Yee, but Yee's arrest for felony racketeering caused Yee to abandon the race. Padilla won the election on November 4, 2014, with 53.6% of the vote, defeating Republican Pete Peterson.On June 29, 2017, the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity, which President Donald Trump created on May 11, requested data on enrolled voters from every state, dating back to 2006. Padilla said that California would not supply the data.On November 6, 2018, Padilla was reelected with 64.5% of the vote, defeating Republican Mark P. Meuser.On October 16, 2020, Padilla was involved in a controversy between the state and the California Republican Party, as the party deployed unofficial ballot boxes for voters to submit their ballots at select locations, including churches and gun stores in competitive California districts. Padilla issued a cease-and-desist order, arguing that the ballot boxes were illegal and failed to ensure ballot security. Local Republican leadership refused to follow the order and said the boxes were a form of legal ballot harvesting that had been enabled by recent Democratic legislation (which lacked a chain of custody requirement), and were a way to increase voter turnout. Accusing Democrats of hypocrisy given their widespread door-to-door ballot harvesting in the 2018 United States elections, the state Republican Party later agreed to a set of collection procedures and said a volunteer's mistake of affixing a sign denoting the ballot box as \"official\" had contributed to the political standoff; Padilla's office said it was continuing to investigate whether ballots were being handled correctly and that the \"ineptitude or unlawfulness of a political operative or campaign volunteer\" could nonetheless lead to \"serious legal consequences\".In early 2020, Padilla announced a $35 million no-bid contract for a statewide voter education ad campaign with partisan public relations firm SKDK (then known as \"SKDKnickerbocker\") called \"Vote Safe California\", but State Controller Betty Yee blocked the funding because Padilla's office did not have the authority to use federal money that was allocated to county governments; the campaign proceeded anyway. The group had marketed itself as being on \"Team Biden\", and the awarding of the no-bid contract under supposed \"emergency powers\" despite the group's ties with the Democratic Party and work for Democratic politicians running for office in California received bipartisan criticism. Amid ongoing litigation by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, who contend that the contract bypassed fair competition rules and misappropriated federal election funding for local elections operations, and was therefore illegal, Governor Newsom signed legislation that provided state funding to reimburse SKDK in February 2021.Upon Padilla's appointment to the U.S. Senate, Newsom appointed Assemblywoman Shirley Weber to succeed him.\n\nUnited States Senator from California (2021–present)\nAppointment\nIn August 2020, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden selected California Senator Kamala Harris as his running mate. After they won the general election, Padilla was mentioned as a possible choice as Harris's successor in the Senate. Governor Newsom had the power to appoint her successor. In December 2020, Newsom announced that he would appoint Padilla to the seat, making him California's first Hispanic senator and the first male U.S. senator from California since Alan Cranston retired in 1993. During the speculation about whom Newsom would appoint, the senior senator from California, Dianne Feinstein, supported Padilla. To replace Padilla as California's secretary of state, Newsom appointed state assemblywoman Shirley Weber.Most Latinos, who are 40% of California's population, supported Padilla's appointment, but some black leaders, who wanted another black woman to replace Harris, criticized it. San Francisco Mayor London Breed called Padilla's appointment \"a real blow to the African American community\".\n\nElections\n2022\nPadilla announced that he would seek a full term in 2022. He appeared on two ballots: one for the special election to fill the remainder of his term in the 117th Congress, and the other for the new term beginning with the 118th Congress. The special election was due to a recent change in California law that ended Padilla's appointment in November 2022. He was on the ballot in two separate races in the November 2022 election—a special election for the final two months of Harris's Senate term, and a regular election for a full six-year term beginning in January 2023.\n\nTenure\nOn January 20, 2021, Padilla was sworn into the United States Senate in the 117th Congress by Vice President Kamala Harris, his predecessor, becoming the first Latino to represent California in the U.S. Senate. He was sworn in by Vice President Harris on her first day, at the same time as new Georgia senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. He served the final two years of Harris's term. He filed the necessary paperwork with the FEC to run for a full term and an unexpired term in the 2022 elections which he won in November 2022.\nWhile in office, Padilla introduced legislation to add more legal protections for various public lands in California, including parts of the San Gabriel Mountains,  Los Padres National Forest, and Carrizo Plain National Monument. Padilla also introduced legislation to help coastal communities adapt shorelines to increased flooding and erosion from sea level rise and extreme weather.\n\nCommittee assignments\nCommittee on the Judiciary\nSubcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Safety (Chairman)\nCommittee on the Budget\nCommittee on Environment and Public Works\nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs\nCommittee on Rules and Administration\n\nCaucus memberships\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus\nSenate Cultural Caucus\nCongressional Asian Pacific American Caucus\nRare Disease Caucus\n\nPolitical positions\nThe Wall Street Journal says that Padilla had \"a reputation [in the State Senate] as a business-friendly moderate\". FiveThirtyEight defined him as a technocrat, not identified with either the progressive or the moderate wing of the party. The American Conservative Union gave Padilla a 0% rating in 2012. On January 18, 2021, Padilla released a statement in support of the Green New Deal and Medicare For All legislation, among other progressive policies.\n\nAbortion\nPadilla favors abortion rights, saying in 2018 that abortion rights are \"not negotiable\". In 2008, Padilla sponsored the bill SB 1770, which would require the Commission on Peace Officer Standards Training (POST) to prepare relevant guidelines and mechanisms for the investigation and reporting of \"cases involving anti-reproductive-rights crimes\". In 2018, after winning the primary for secretary of state to seek a second term, he received support from NARAL Pro-Choice America.When Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022, Padilla condemned the decision.\n\nLGBTQIA+ rights\nPadilla supports transgender rights.\n\nClimate and environment\nPadilla supports climate action and said during budgetary discussions in October 2021 that \"[c]limate cannot be on the chopping block in this or any budget.\" He supports the Green New Deal and has said that it \"offers a once-in-a-generation opportunity.\" Padilla received a 100% score from the League of Conservation Voters in 2021.\n\nFilibuster\nPadilla supports ending the Senate filibuster.\n\nImmigration\nPadilla supports immigrants' rights. On January 15, 2021, he said that he supports legislation sponsored by representative Joaquin Castro to speed up the citizenship process for undocumented immigrants in essential jobs, declaring that because of the work they do, \"they deserve stability\".\n\nVoting rights\nPadilla has been known for efforts to expand voting access. When he was appointed to the Senate in 2021, Newsom called him \"a national defender of voting rights\".\n\nPersonal life\nPadilla married Angela Monzon in 2012. They have three sons and live in the San Fernando Valley's Porter Ranch neighborhood. In late 2015 and early 2016, the Aliso Canyon gas leak temporarily displaced the Padillas from their home.\n\nElectoral history\nSee also\nList of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the United States Congress\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nSenator Alex Padilla official U.S. Senate website\nAlex Padilla for Senate campaign website\nAppearances on C-SPANBiography at the Biographical Directory of the United States Congress\nFinancial information (federal office) at the Federal Election Commission\nLegislation sponsored at the Library of Congress\nProfile at Vote Smart",

Proposition 23 would have required chronic dialysis clinics to: have an on-site physician while patients are being treated; report data on dialysis-related infections; obtain consent from the state health department before closing a clinic; and not discriminate against patients based on the source of payment for care.[2]\nIn 2018,  SEIU-UHW also sponsored Proposition 8, which was defeated with 59.9% of voters rejecting it. Proposition 8 would have required dialysis clinics to issue refunds to patients or patients' payers for revenue above 115% of the costs of direct patient care and healthcare improvements.[3]\n\nWho supported and opposed Proposition 29?\nSee also: Support and Opposition\nCalifornians for Kidney Dialysis Patient Protection led the Kidney Patients Deserve Better campaign in support of Proposition 29. SEIU-UHW West was the primary sponsor and contributed over $7.97 million to the support committee. David Miller, research director of SEIU-UHW, said, \"There’s just so much improvement that can be made, and there’s plenty of resources in the industry to make those improvements. That’s the tension: there’s enormous profitability, then you meet folks of enormous need, and you realize that some of that money should be diverted to patient care.\"[4]\nStop Yet Another Dangerous Dialysis Proposition led the campaign in opposition to Proposition 29. The committee reported nearly $74.6 million in contributions from DaVita Inc. and Fresenius Medical Care. The initiative was also opposed by the Republican Party of California, California Chamber of Commerce, and California Medical Association. The campaign said, \"Since 2012, UHW has wasted $77.7 million of its members’ dues money funding 48 failed ballot initiatives across the country – many of which put patients and their members at risk. That amounts to more than $700 per UHW member that they’ve wasted on these failed and reckless efforts. This is the third ballot measure since 2018 sponsored by UHW targeting dialysis providers. Voters rejected Prop 8 in 2018 by 60% and Prop 23 in 2020 by 63%. It’s shameful that this union would continue to use vulnerable patients as pawns to advance their political agenda.\"[5]\n\nText of measure\nThe ballot title was as follows:[6]\n\n\n\n“\n\n\nRequires on-site Licensed Medical Professional at Kidney Dialysis Clinics and Establishes Other State Requirements.

The average profit margin for DaVita and Fresenius clinics in the United States is 16% and 15.8% respectively — nearly six times as high as the average profit margin for US hospitals.\" \nDavid Miller, research director of SEIU-UHW: \"There’s just so much improvement that can be made, and there’s plenty of resources in the industry to make those improvements. That’s the tension: there’s enormous profitability, then you meet folks of enormous need, and you realize that some of that money should be diverted to patient care.\" \n\n\nOfficial arguments\nThe following is the argument in support of Proposition 29 found in the Official Voter Information Guide:[9]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Voter Information Guide: Life-Saving Changes for Dialysis Patients\n\nThree times every week, 80,000 Californians with End Stage Renal Disease go to one of more than 600 commercial dialysis centers in the state where they spend several hours connected to a machine that removes their blood, cleans it, and returns it to their bodies. Dialysis literally is what keeps them alive, and they must continue the treatment for the rest of their lives or until they receive a kidney transplant.\n\nBecause the lives of these fellow Californians are so dependent on dialysis done both safely and effectively, we must give our absolute support to the Protect the Lives of Dialysis Patients Act on the Nov. 8 ballot. This initiative makes common-sense improvements to dialysis treatment to protect some of the most medically vulnerable Californians.\n\nThe initiative does five major things:\n\nFirst, it requires a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant to be in the clinic whenever patients are being treated, which is not currently required. Dialysis is a dangerous procedure, and if something goes wrong, a doctor or highly trained clinician should be nearby.\n\nSecond, as dialysis patients are prone to infections that can lead to more serious illnesses or even death, it requires clinics to report data on infections to the state so problems can be identified and solved to better protect patients.\n\nThird, as life-saving health care facilities, it requires dialysis corporations to get approval from the state before closing clinics or reducing services. This will protect access to dialysis treatment, particularly for patients in rural communities.\n\nFourth, it prohibits clinics from discriminating against patients because of their type of insurance and protects patients in every clinic. Whether in a wealthy neighborhood or a poor, rural, Black or Brown community, all clinics will be required to have a doctor or other highly trained clinician on-site and to report their infection rates, and all dialysis corporations will be prohibited from discriminating against patients based on insurance type.\n\nFifth, it increases transparency and helps patients make informed decisions for their care by requiring clinics and dialysis corporations to disclose information on ownership. As joint ventures between dialysis clinics and doctors become more common, improved transparency is needed to allow stakeholders and policy makers to study the effects of physician ownership.\n\nDon’t fall for big dialysis corporations’ claims that this initiative will create huge new costs, harm patients, or create a shortage of doctors—those fake arguments are just designed as scare tactics in their dishonest public relations campaign. The fact is these corporations can easily make these changes and still profit hundreds of millions of dollars a year without disrupting our healthcare system.\n\nProposition 29 will make the changes we need to truly protect dialysis patients. We urge you to vote YES!\n\n--- Emanuel Gonzales, Dialysis Patient Care Technician; Reverend Kisheen W. Tulloss, President, The Baptist Ministers Conference of Los Angeles; and Cecilia Gomez-Gonzalez, Dialysis Patient Advocate \n\n\n\nOpposition\nStop Yet Another Dangerous Dialysis Proposition led the campaign in opposition to Proposition 29.[10]\n\nOpponents\n\n\nPolitical Parties\n\n\n\nRepublican Party of California\n\n\n\nOrganizations\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Academy of Nephrology PAs\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Medical Association\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Taxpayer Protection Committee\n\n\n\n\nNational Hispanic Medical Association\n\n\nArguments\n\n\nOfficial arguments\nThe following is the argument in opposition to Proposition 29 found in the Official Voter Information Guide:[11]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Voter Information Guide: DIALYSIS PATIENTS STRONGLY OPPOSE PROP. 29 BECAUSE IT PUTS OUR LIVES AT RISK\n\n\"This is the third time a special interest has placed a proposition on the ballot putting my life and the lives of 80,000 other dialysis patients at risk. Twice, voters have overwhelmingly rejected these dangerous propositions. Please, reject Prop. 29 to stop yet another dangerous dialysis proposition.\"—Angel De Los Santos, dialysis patient, Los Angeles\n\n\"I’ve been on dialysis for two years. Dialysis is literally my life support. I am so angry that one special interest is pushing a third proposition that puts my life at risk. Please, protect patients like me . . . again. Vote NO on 29.\"—Rachel Sprinkle-Strong, dialysis patient, Sacramento\n\nPROP. 29 WOULD FORCE COMMUNITY DIALYSIS CLINICS TO CUT SERVICES OR SHUT DOWN—RISKING PATIENTS’ LIVES\n\nDialysis patients, nurses and doctors strongly oppose Prop. 29. More than 80,000 Californians with failed kidneys need dialysis treatments three days a week to stay alive. Missing even a single dialysis treatment increases patients’ risk of death by 30%.\n\nProposition 29 would force dialysis clinics to have new administrators on-site at all times—even though they would not provide direct patient care. This unnecessary requirement would cost hundreds of millions every year, forcing dialysis clinics throughout the state to cut back services or shut down, making it harder for patients to access their treatments—putting their lives at risk.\n\nDIALYSIS CLINICS ARE STRICTLY REGULATED AND PROVIDE HIGH QUALITY CARE\n\nCalifornia’s dialysis clinics are regulated by federal and state agencies and have high ratings for quality care and patient satisfaction. Each dialysis patient in California is under the care of their own kidney specialist and dialysis treatments are administered by specially trained nurses and licensed technicians. It makes no sense to also require a physician administrator on-site full-time who will not be involved in providing care.\n\nPROP. 29 WOULD WORSEN OUR HEALTH CARE WORKER SHORTAGE AND LEAD TO MORE EMERGENCY ROOM OVERCROWDING\n\n\"Proposition 29 would take thousands of doctors, physician assistants and nurse practitioners away from hospitals and clinics—where they’re needed—and place them into administrative jobs at dialysis clinics where they aren’t.\"—Marketa Houskova, Doctor of Nursing Practice, RN, Executive Director of American Nurses Association\\California.\n\n\"Prop. 29 would make our growing physician shortage even worse by taking doctors away from hospitals and clinics where they are needed, increasing wait times and reducing capacity to deal with other medical emergencies.\"—Robert E. Wailes, M.D., President, California Medical Association\n\nANOTHER SPECIAL INTEREST ABUSE\n\nThis is the third time this special interest has placed similar dialysis measures on the ballot. Twice, California voters have overwhelmingly rejected these measures. Special interests need to respect the will of the voters and stop threatening dialysis patients’ lives.\n\nJOIN DIALYSIS PATIENTS, FAMILIES, NURSES AND DOCTORS: NO ON 29\n\nProp. 29 opposed by: • Tens of thousands of dialysis patients and families • American Nurses Association\\California • American Academy of Nephrology Physician Assistants • Dialysis Patient Citizens, representing thousands of patients • California Medical Association, representing 40,000 California physicians • Emergency room doctors\n\nwww.NoProp29.com\n\n---Anthony Hicks, Kidney Dialysis Patient; Angelic Nicole Gant, Kidney Dialysis Patient; and Gregory Ridgeway, Kidney Dialysis Patient \n\n\n\nCampaign finance\nSee also: Campaign finance requirements for California ballot measures\nThe campaign finance information on this page reflects the most recently scheduled reports processed by Ballotpedia, which covered through January 31, 2023.\nThe PAC Californians for Kidney Dialysis Patient Protection\twas registered to support the ballot initiative.

If a dialysis center has issues with a patient, staff can contact physicians immediately and they can send a patient to a hospital if needed. Vote NO on Prop 29.\" \nMercury News & East Bay Times Editorial Boards: \"Regulation of the industry is complex and best suited for the Legislature rather than the ballot box. If changes are needed, lawmakers should hear from experts in the field, thoroughly vet any new laws and be open to alterations dictated by sound medical advice. The California Medical Association understands that, which is why it steadfastly opposes Prop. 29. ... Voters have rejected the two previous kidney dialysis ballot measures with good reason. They should do so again by voting no on Prop. 29.\" \nSanta Cruz Sentinel Editorial Board: \"Proposition 29 on the November ballot is an abuse of California’s election system – again. For the third time in five years, leaders of a large labor union are asking voters to approve unnecessary regulations for the kidney dialysis industry that would make it harder for patients to receive critical care. ... Voters have rejected the two previous kidney dialysis ballot measures for good reason. They should do so again and vote no on Prop. 29.\" \nMarin Independent Journal Editorial Board: \"Voters have rejected the two previous kidney dialysis ballot measures with good reason. They should do so again by voting no on Prop. 29.\" \nLos Angeles Times Editorial Board: \"The proponents says the proposition is intended to improve patient care. It’s an assertion they can’t back up with evidence. No other state requires a doctor on-site, nor do the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or the California State Department of Public Health, which regulates dialysis centers. Nor is there evidence that the current arrangement has harmed patients. ... Voters should reject Proposition 29.\" \nSan Francisco Chronicle Editorial Board: \"Nearly 75% of licensed dialysis clinics in California are owned or operated by two for-profit companies: DaVita Inc. and Fresenius Medical Care. Proponents of Prop. 29 don’t hide the fact that they see this measure as part of a strategy to unionize the facilities owned by these companies. ... Voters should reject Prop. 29’s cynical tactics in November — and as many times as they need to in the future.\" \nThe Orange County Register Editorial Board: \"The union thinks that the admittedly small number of firms that run most of the dialysis clinics in this state and throughout the country are too profitable, and this irks them. Again, not a good reason to legally demand artificially high staffing levels just to spite them. That’s why the state’s physicians and other healthcare providers, including the California Medical Association, American Nurses AssociationCalifornia and the American Academy of Nephrology PAs all oppose Prop. 29. ... Vote no on Prop. 29 this November.\" \nThe San Diego Union-Tribune Editorial Board: \"The union thinks if it forces the companies to spend around $100 million every two years to defend the status quo, they will stop opposing unionization. That this tactic could kill people is apparently of no concern. The San Diego Union-Tribune Editorial Board recommends a 'no' vote on Proposition 29.\" \nThe Sacramento Bee Editorial Board: \"Voters resoundingly rejected nearly identical propositions in 2018 and 2020, and they should do the same this year. Proposition 29, the Dialysis Clinic Requirements Initiative, is not a significant improvement on the earlier attempts. Just like the previous measures, it’s a proposed solution in search of a problem.\" \n\n\n\n\nBackground\nCalifornia Proposition 8 (2018)\nSee also: California Proposition 8, Limits on Dialysis Clinics' Revenue and Required Refunds Initiative (2018)\nIn 2018, the campaign Californians for Kidney Dialysis Patient Protection supported a ballot initiative to require dialysis clinics to issue refunds to patients or patients' payers for revenue above 115% of the costs of direct patient care and healthcare improvements.[13] On the ballot as Proposition 8, 59.9% of voters rejected the proposal. On November 7, 2018, Californians for Kidney Dialysis Patient Protection announced that a similar ballot initiative would be filed for 2020.[3]\nThe committees in support or opposition of Proposition 8 had raised a combined $130.43 million, making the ballot measure the most expensive of 2018. The SEIU-UHW West sponsored Californians for Kidney Dialysis Patient Protection, which raised $18.94 million. The California Democratic Party and California Labor Federation supported the campaign. Opponents, organized as Patients and Caregivers to Protect Dialysis Patients, raised $111.48 million, with DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care North America providing 90% of the campaign's funds.[12]\n\n\nCalifornia Proposition 23 (2020)\nSee also: California Proposition 23, Dialysis Clinic Requirements Initiative (2020)\nIn 2020, the SEIU-UHW West launched a new campaign for a ballot initiative to have a minimum of one licensed physician present at the clinic while patients are being treated; report data on dialysis-related infections to the state health department and National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN); and provide a written notice to the state health department and obtain consent from the state health department before closing a chronic dialysis clinic.[2] At the election on November 3, 2020, 63.4% of voters rejected the ballot initiative.[14]\nProposition 23 saw $114.23 million raised between supporters and opponents. The Californians for Kidney Dialysis Patient Protection PAC raised $8.99 million from the SEIU-UHW West. The Stop the Dangerous & Costly Dialysis Proposition PAC was registered to oppose the ballot initiative. The committee had raised $105.24 million, with $66.8 million from DaVita, Inc. and $29.8 million from Fresenius Medical Care.[12]\n\n\nConflict between labor and dialysis businesses\nPropositions 8 and 23 established a new front in the conflict between the SEIU-UHW West, a labor organization, and the state's two largest dialysis businesses DaVita and Fresenius Medical Care.\nThe SEIU-UHW West said workers at dialysis clinics had been attempting to unionize since 2016, but that their employers were retaliating against pro-union employees.[15] Kent Thiry, CEO of DaVita, argued that \"Proposition 8 puts California patients at risk in an effort to force unionization of employees.\"[16][17] Kathy Fairbanks, an opposition spokesperson, similarly stated, \"[Sponsors] want to bring the dialysis community to the table and unionize it. This is just leverage.\"[18] Wherley, a spokesperson for the SEIU-UHW West, contended that dialysis workers \"want these [initiative] reforms regardless of what happens with their union efforts.\"[19] Dave Regan stated, \"The reason Prop. 8 is on the ballot is because they have a terrible business model and they’re gouging patients and insurers.\"[16]\nJim Miller, a columnist for The Sacramento Bee, and Melanie Mason, a state politics journalist for the Los Angeles Times, both stated that the ballot initiative would also provide the SEIU-UHW West with leverage over legislation to enact new regulations on dialysis clinics in the California State Legislature.[19][20] Wherley said the union was taking a two-pronged approach, wanting to make \"sure we have as many options available as possible.\"[19] In 2017, legislation was introduced, but not passed, to require staff-patient ratios in dialysis clinics and, like the ballot initiative, limit the revenue of businesses.[21][22][23][19][24]\n\nWhat is dialysis treatment?\nDialysis is a medical treatment that removes waste products and excess fluids and chemicals from a person's bloodstream. Dialysis is recommended when a person's kidneys lose most of their function. Kidneys filter a person's blood, removing wastes, excess water, and surplus chemicals and nutrients. The substances removed from the bloodstream are deposited in the bladder and discharged as urine.[25][26][27]\nThere are two main types of dialysis treatment—hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\n\nHemodialysis: Before hemodialysis treatments can begin, surgeons create an access point, typically in an arm, to allow technicians to remove blood for treatments. Tubing is attached to allow blood to be pumped between the access point and a hemodialyzer machine, also known as an artificial kidney machine. The machine filters the blood and adds a solution to help remove waste. How often a person needs hemodialysis treatment can vary. According to the National Kidney Foundation, hemodialysis treatments usually occur three times per week and take around four hours each time.[28][29]\nPeritoneal dialysis: Surgeons insert a catheter into the lining of a person's abdomen. The treatment involves pumping a solution into the abdomen. The solution absorbs wastes and uses the lining of the abdomen as a filter. A few hours after the solution has been pumped into the abdomen, the catheter is reopened to allow the solution to drain. Peritoneal dialysis typically occurs three to five times every day, with each treatment taking about 30 to 40 minutes, according to the National Kidney Foundation.[30][31]\nPath to the ballot\nSee also: Laws governing the initiative process in California\nProcess in California\nIn California, the number of signatures required for an initiated state statute is equal to 5 percent of the votes cast in the preceding gubernatorial election. Petitions are allowed to circulate for 180 days from the date the attorney general prepares the petition language. Signatures need to be certified at least 131 days before the general election. As the verification process can take multiple months, the secretary of state provides suggested deadlines for ballot initiatives.\nThe requirements to get initiated state statutes certified for the 2022 ballot:\n\nSignatures: 623,212 valid signatures were required.\nDeadline: The deadline for signature verification was 131 days before the general election, which was around June 30, 2022. However, the process of verifying signatures can take multiple months and proponents are recommended to file signatures at least two months before the verification deadline.\nSignatures are first filed with local election officials, who determine the total number of signatures submitted. If the total number is equal to at least 100 percent of the required signatures, then local election officials perform a random check of signatures submitted in their counties. If the random sample estimates that more than 110 percent of the required number of signatures are valid, the initiative is eligible for the ballot. If the random sample estimates that between 95 and 110 percent of the required number of signatures are valid, a full check of signatures is done to determine the total number of valid signatures. If less than 95 percent are estimated to be valid, the initiative does not make the ballot.\n\nInitiative #20-0013\nSean Fleming and Jonathan Everhart filed the ballot initiative on August 24, 2021. The attorney general of California issued ballot language for the initiative on October 29, 2021, allowing a signature drive to begin. Signatures were due on April 27, 2022. Proponents reported collecting 25% of the required signatures (155,803) on January 24, 2022.[32]\nThe initiative campaign submitted 1,018,730 raw signatures.[33]\nOn June 20, 2022, the secretary of state reported that the random sample concluded that 725,890 signatures were valid.[34]\nSponsors of the measure hired Kimball Petition Management to collect signatures for the petition to qualify this measure for the ballot. A total of $13,374,336.75 was spent to collect the 623,212 valid signatures required to put this measure before voters, resulting in a total cost per required signature (CPRS) of $21.46.\n\n\nHow to cast a vote\nSee also: Voting in California\nClick \"Show\" to learn more about voter registration, identification requirements, and poll times in California.\n\n\n\nHow to cast a vote in California\n\n\n\nPoll times\nAll polls in California are open from 7:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. Pacific Time. An individual who is in line at the time polls close must be allowed to vote.[35]\n\nRegistration\nTo vote in California, an individual must be a U.S. citizen and California resident. A voter must be at least 18 years of age on Election Day. Pre-registration is available at 16 years of age. Pre-registration automatically registers voters when they turn 18.[36]\nOn October 10, 2015, California Governor Jerry Brown (D) signed into law Assembly Bill No. 1461, also known as the New Motor Voter Act. The legislation, which took effect in 2016, authorized automatic voter registration in California for any individuals who visit the Department of Motor Vehicles to acquire or renew a driver's license.[37][38]\n\nAutomatic registration\nCalifornia  automatically registers eligible individuals to vote when they complete a driver's license, identification (ID) card, or change of address transaction through the Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\nOnline registration\nSee also: Online voter registration\nCalifornia has implemented an online voter registration system. Residents can register to vote by visiting this website.\n\nSame-day registration\nCalifornia allows same-day voter registration.\nCalifornians must be registered to vote at least 15 days before Election Day. If the registration deadline has passed for an upcoming election, voters may visit a location designated by their county elections official during the 14 days prior to, and including Election Day to conditionally register to vote and vote a provisional ballot. The state refers to this process as Same Day Voter Registration.[39]\n\nResidency requirements\nTo register to vote in California, you must be a resident of the state. State law does not specify a length of time for which you must have been a resident to be eligible.\n\nVerification of citizenship\nSee also: Laws permitting noncitizens to vote in the United States\nCalifornia's constitution requires that voters be U.S. citizens. When registering to vote, proof of citizenship is not required. Individuals who become U.S. citizens less than 15 days before an election must bring proof of citizenship to their county elections office to register to vote in that election.[39]\n\nVerifying your registration\nThe site Voter Status, run by the California Secretary of State's office, allows residents to check their voter registration status online.\n\nVoter ID requirements\nCalifornia does not require voters to present photo identification. However, some voters may be asked to show a form of identification when voting if they are voting for the first time after registering to vote by mail and did not provide a driver license number, California identification number, or the last four digits of their social security number.[40][41]\nThe following list of accepted ID was current as of March 2023.
